# Issue #106: Order Bump Feature - Executive Summary

## Request
Add an order bump/upsell on all downloader checkout pages where customers can upgrade to "all downloaders" for +$47.

## Recommendation: Pre-Checkout UI Order Bump ⭐

### What It Is
A checkbox/toggle on the checkout page (before payment) that lets customers upgrade their single downloader purchase ($17) to access ALL 95+ downloaders for just +$47 more (total: $64).

### Why This Approach
1. **Best User Experience** - Clear pricing before payment
2. **Highest Conversion** - No payment friction
3. **Easy Implementation** - Works with existing Stripe setup
4. **Clean Analytics** - Track everything in one session

### Expected Results
- **15-25% acceptance rate** (industry standard for order bumps)
- **Average order value** increases from $17 to $22-25
- **Additional revenue**: ~$15-20K/month (at 1000 checkouts/month)
- **Customer value**: Save $1,400+ (vs buying all separately)

### Alternatives Considered
