# Terms of Service

_Last updated: September 19, 2025_

These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of the software products, landing pages, and related services (collectively, the "Services") provided by SERP Apps and its affiliates ("Company", "we", "us", or "our"). By purchasing, downloading, installing, or otherwise using the Services, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the Services.

## 1. Eligibility & Account Responsibilities

You must be at least 18 years old, or the age of majority in your jurisdiction, to purchase and use the Services. You are responsible for maintaining the accuracy of the contact and billing information you provide and for all activity that occurs under your account, even if performed by third parties that you authorize.

## 2. License & Permitted Use

Upon purchase, the Company grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to install and use the software for your own internal business or personal purposes. You may not:

- Resell, redistribute, or sublicense the Services without prior written consent.
- Reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to derive the source code, except as permitted by applicable law.
- Use the Services to engage in any unlawful, infringing, or harmful activity.
- Circumvent technical restrictions or licensing controls imposed to protect the Services.

## 3. Payment & Renewals

All fees are due at the time of purchase unless explicitly stated otherwise on the checkout page. Pricing and renewal terms (for any subscription or ongoing services) are disclosed before you submit payment. You authorize us and our payment processors to charge the payment method you provide for all purchases, renewals, add-ons, and applicable taxes.

## 4. Refund Policy

Refund requests are handled in accordance with our [Refund Policy](https://github.com/serpapps/legal/blob/main/refund-policy.md). Unless otherwise required by law, all sales are considered final once the license key or download link has been delivered.

## 5. Updates & Support

We may release updates, bug fixes, or new features from time to time. Unless your purchase explicitly includes ongoing support, we make no guarantee regarding future updates or technical assistance. When support is provided, it is limited to reasonable efforts to address product defects or setup questions.

## 6. Third-Party Services

Some Services may interface with third-party platforms (such as payment processors, CRM systems, or video hosting providers). Your use of those platforms is subject to their own terms and policies. We are not responsible for any third-party service outages, changes, or limitations that impact the functionality of our Services.

## 7. Intellectual Property

All intellectual property rights in the Services remain with the Company or its licensors. Trademarks, logos, and product names referenced are the property of their respective owners. Nothing in these Terms transfers ownership of any intellectual property rights to you.

## 8. Acceptable Use & Compliance

You agree not to use the Services to violate any applicable laws, regulations, or rights of third parties, including intellectual property rights and privacy laws. You are solely responsible for ensuring that your use of downloaded or captured content complies with the terms of the source platform and any licenses granted by content owners.

## 9. Disclaimers & Limitation of Liability

The Services are provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for lost profits or data, arising out of or related to your use of the Services.

Our total cumulative liability for any claim arising out of or relating to the Services is limited to the amount you paid for the applicable product in the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim.

## 10. Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services at any time if we believe you have violated these Terms or engaged in fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful activity. Upon termination, your license to use the Services immediately ends, and you must cease all use.

## 11. Changes to These Terms

We may update these Terms from time to time by posting an updated version at the URL provided. Changes become effective on the "Last updated" date noted above. Your continued use of the Services after changes are posted constitutes your acceptance of the revised Terms.

## 12. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes arising under or in connection with the Services shall be resolved in the state or federal courts located in San Francisco County, California, and you consent to the personal jurisdiction of such courts.
