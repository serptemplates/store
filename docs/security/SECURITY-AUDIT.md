# Security & Production-Readiness Audit

**Date:** $(date)  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Audit Type:** Pre-Launch Security & Production Review  
**Revenue at Risk:** $10,000+ monthly  

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL ISSUES (Must Fix Before Launch)

### 1. Missing Security Headers ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Risk:** XSS attacks, clickjacking, MIME-type sniffing vulnerabilities  
**Impact:** Could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts or steal customer payment data  

**Current State:** No security headers configured in Next.js config  

**Required Headers:**
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Prevent clickjacking
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` - Prevent MIME-type sniffing
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` - Control referrer information
- `Permissions-Policy` - Restrict browser features
- `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` - Enforce HTTPS
- `Content-Security-Policy` - Prevent XSS attacks

**Action Required:** Add security headers to `next.config.mjs`

### 2. Sensitive Data in Logs ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Risk:** PII (email addresses) and payment data exposed in application logs  
**Impact:** GDPR violations, customer privacy breach, potential data theft  

**Affected Files:**
- `lib/ghl-client.ts:71` - Logs request body which may contain customer email
- *(Legacy)* `app/api/paypal/webhook/route.ts` – Route removed with the Stripe Payment Link migration; retain this note only for historical audits.
- *(Legacy)* `app/api/checkout/session/route.ts` – Removed in favour of Stripe Payment Links.

**Action Required:** Implement PII redaction in logger and remove debug console.log statements

### 3. Rate Limiting Uses In-Memory Storage ⚠️ HIGH PRIORITY
**Risk:** Rate limits reset on server restart, can be bypassed with distributed attacks  
**Impact:** DDoS attacks could overwhelm checkout API, causing revenue loss  

**Current State:** Legacy helper (`lib/rate-limit.ts`) was removed; no app-level limiter is in place.

**Action Required:** Implement a Redis/Vercel KV–backed limiter and wire it into public endpoints before launch.

### 4. Missing CORS Configuration ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Risk:** API endpoints accessible from any origin  
**Impact:** CSRF attacks possible, unauthorized API access  

**Action Required:** Configure CORS to allow only trusted domains

### 5. Environment Variables Not Validated at Startup ⚠️ MEDIUM PRIORITY
**Risk:** Application starts with missing critical configuration  
**Impact:** Silent failures in production, failed payments, lost revenue  

**Action Required:** Add startup validation for all required environment variables

---

## 🟡 IMPORTANT ISSUES (Fix Within Week 1)

### 6. Webhook Signature Verification Edge Cases
**Risk:** Malformed webhook signatures could bypass validation  
**Impact:** Fraudulent orders could be created  

**Current State:** `lib/contracts/validation.middleware.ts` has basic validation  
**Recommendation:** Add comprehensive test coverage for edge cases

### 7. SQL Injection Protection Not Explicit
**Risk:** While using parameterized queries, not all database operations are audited  
**Impact:** Potential data breach  

**Current State:** Using Vercel Postgres with tagged templates (safe)  
**Recommendation:** Add explicit SQL injection test cases

### 8. No Request Size Limits
**Risk:** Large payloads could cause memory exhaustion  
**Impact:** Service outage  

**Action Required:** Add payload size limits to API routes

### 9. Error Messages Expose Internal Details
**Risk:** Stack traces and internal paths visible in error responses  
**Impact:** Information disclosure aids attackers  

**Action Required:** Sanitize error messages in production

### 10. Missing Monitoring for Failed Payments
**Risk:** Failed payments not tracked systematically  
**Impact:** Lost revenue, poor customer experience  

**Action Required:** Add dedicated monitoring for payment failures

---

## 🟢 MINOR ISSUES (Fix Within Week 2)

### 11. Console.log Statements in Production Code
**Files:**
- `app/api/paypal/webhook/route.ts:23,28`
- `app/api/test/checkout/route.ts:*`
- (Legacy) `app/api/checkout/session/route.ts` — already removed.

**Action:** Replace with structured logging via `lib/logger.ts`

### 12. Missing API Response Time Tracking
**Impact:** Cannot detect performance degradation  
**Action:** Add response time logging to critical API routes

### 13. No Automated Backup Verification
**Impact:** Backup corruption may go unnoticed  
**Action:** Add daily backup verification checks

### 14. Missing Customer Data Export Functionality
**Impact:** GDPR compliance gap  
**Action:** Implement data export API for customer requests

### 15. No Rate Limiting on Contact Form
**Impact:** Spam potential  
**Action:** Add rate limiting to `/api/contact` and `/api/waitlist`

---

## ✅ SECURITY STRENGTHS

### What's Working Well:

1. **Input Validation** ✅
   - Strong Zod schemas in `lib/validation/checkout.ts`
   - Regex validation for IDs, emails, phone numbers
   - HTML/script tag sanitization

2. **Webhook Security** ✅
   - Stripe signature verification implemented
   - PayPal signature verification (legacy) – no longer active, retained for historical audits
   - Replay attack protection via event IDs

3. **Rate Limiting** ✅
   - Checkout API: 30 requests/minute
   - Webhook API: 100 requests/minute
   - Per-IP tracking

4. **Database Security** ✅
   - Parameterized queries (SQL injection safe)
   - Connection pooling configured
   - Proper indexes for performance

5. **GHL Integration Security** ✅
   - Retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Error handling for failed syncs
   - Ops alerts on failures

6. **Payment Processing** ✅
   - Stripe handles PCI compliance
   - No card data stored locally
   - Payment intents tracked properly

7. **HTTPS Enforcement** ✅
   - Middleware tracks secure cookies
   - Production-only secure cookie flag
