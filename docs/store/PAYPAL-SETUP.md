## üîç Monitoring PayPal Transactions

### Database Queries

```sql
-- View PayPal orders
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE source = 'paypal'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check PayPal webhook logs
SELECT * FROM webhook_logs
WHERE metadata->>'source' = 'paypal'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- PayPal conversion rate
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE status = 'completed') * 100.0 /
  COUNT(*) as conversion_rate
FROM checkout_sessions
WHERE source = 'paypal';
```

### PayPal Dashboard
- View transactions: [paypal.com/activities](https://www.paypal.com/activities)
- Check disputes: Business > Resolution Center
- Download reports: Reports > All Reports

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"PayPal is not configured" error**
   - Ensure all environment variables are set
   - Restart the development server after adding env vars

2. **Payment not captured**
   - Check webhook configuration
   - Verify webhook signature if PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID is set
   - Check server logs for capture errors

3. **GHL sync not working**
   - Same troubleshooting as Stripe orders
   - Check `ghlSyncedAt` field in database
   - Review webhook_logs for errors

4. **Button not appearing**
   - Verify NEXT_PUBLIC_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID is set
   - Check browser console for PayPal SDK errors
   - Ensure no ad blockers are interfering

## üé® Customization

### Button Styles

The PayPal button can be customized in `components/paypal-button.tsx`:

```tsx
<PayPalButtons
  style={{
    layout: "vertical",  // or "horizontal"
    color: "gold",       // or "blue", "silver", "white", "black"
    shape: "rect",       // or "pill"
    label: "paypal",     // or "checkout", "buynow", "pay"
  }}
/>
```

### Checkout Flow

Currently configured for immediate capture. To change to authorize-first:

```typescript
// In lib/paypal.ts, change intent:
intent: "AUTHORIZE"  // Instead of "CAPTURE"
```

## üìä A/B Testing PayPal vs Stripe

Track conversion by payment method:

```typescript
// Track in analytics
gtag('event', 'begin_checkout', {
  payment_method: 'paypal',
  value: price,
  currency: 'USD'
});
```

Monitor in Google Analytics:
- Conversions by payment method
- Average order value by method
- Cart abandonment by method

## üîí Security Notes

1. **Never expose secrets**
   - Only use NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix for client ID
   - Keep client secret server-side only

2. **Verify webhooks**
   - Always verify webhook signatures in production
   - Use PAYPAL_WEBHOOK_ID for verification

3. **Validate amounts**
   - Always verify payment amount matches expected
   - Check currency matches your configuration

## üìà Performance Impact

- PayPal SDK adds ~85KB to bundle (lazy loaded)
- Initial load time impact: minimal (async loading)
- Checkout redirect time: 2-3 seconds
- Webhook processing: < 500ms
