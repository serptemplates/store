  "description": "AI Voice Cloner App turns short audio samples into production-ready voice models in minutes. Feed it 3 to 30 seconds of clean speech and the neural engine analyses pitch, cadence, and inflection before letting you type any script and hear it back in the cloned voice.\n\nFlexible input options let you drag and drop WAV, MP3, FLAC, or record directly inside the desktop interface. A guided workflow trims your best segments, selects Fast, Balanced, or High Quality presets, and generates speech 5 to 10 times faster than real time with adjustable speed, pitch, and emphasis controls.\n\nEverything runs under a privacy-first architecture. Voice models, projects, and exports stay on your machine by default, with optional cloud acceleration, password-protected archives, invisible watermarks, and consent verification tools when you need them.\n\nHigh-quality source audio is essentialâ€”studio-style recordings produce near-human realism while noisy clips reduce accuracy. Use the app for ethical, disclosed projects such as creative production, accessibility, localization, and personal voice preservation.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I create my first voice clone?",
      "answer": "Start a new project, upload or record a clean 10 to 30 second sample, trim the best segment, pick a training preset, and let the app build the model. Once training finishes you can type text, adjust pitch or speed, and export the cloned voice in a few clicks."
    },
    {
      "question": "What audio quality delivers the best results?",
      "answer": "Use high-bitrate recordings captured in a quiet space. Studio microphones or lossless exports produce 85-95 percent natural accuracy, while noisy or compressed files can drop quality to 60-75 percent."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the app work offline?",
      "answer": "Yes. All training, storage, and speech generation run locally. You can optionally enable cloud acceleration for faster training, but it is not required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can it operate as a real-time voice changer?",
      "answer": "No. The app generates audio files you can preview and export. It is not designed for live streaming or instant voice replacement on calls."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does training take and what hardware is recommended?",
      "answer": "Training typically takes 2 to 10 minutes depending on quality settings and whether you use CPU-only or GPU acceleration. Any modern Windows, macOS, or Linux machine works; a dedicated GPU speeds the workflow up considerably."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do exported files include watermarks?",
      "answer": "Free mode watermarks audio and limits clones. Lifetime buyers get watermark-free exports, and Pro adds advanced pronunciation controls plus commercial usage rights."
