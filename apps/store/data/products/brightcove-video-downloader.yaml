  - Deliver high-quality MP4 handoffs without hiring engineering to pull manifests

faqs:
- question: Can Brightcove Video Downloader access SSO-protected portals?
  answer: Yes. If you can view the video after authenticating with SSO, the downloader
    reuses that browser session to pull the stream. It never bypasses permissions
    you do not already have.
- question: Does it work with the latest Brightcove player embeds?
  answer: The extension recognises both classic and modern Brightcove player deployments,
    including inline and modal embeds on marketing sites.
- question: Are DRM-protected videos supported?
  answer: Brightcove implementations that layer DRM (Widevine, PlayReady, FairPlay)
    are not supported. Non-DRM HLS and DASH streams download normally.
- question: Will captions or cue points be saved?
  answer: Video and audio export in MP4 format. Cue points and chapter metadata are
    written to a companion JSON for reference. Subtitle packaging is on the roadmap.
- question: Can I queue an entire playlist?
  answer: Yes. Add multiple assets to the queue and the downloader will process them
    sequentially, keeping progress, retries, and final filenames organised.
