It detects every available resolution, handles HLS streams behind the page, and keeps downloads moving even when you minimise the tab.\n\nChoose the quality you want, let the extension pull the stream segments, and it merges them in the background while you browse.

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I download a Redtube video?",
      "answer": "Open the video, click the downloader icon, pick your preferred resolution, and let the progress bar finish. The MP4 saves to your downloads folder with the video title."

    {
      "question": "Does it work on embedded Redtube players?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Will it keep downloading if I reload the page?",
      "answer": "Progress persists even if you refresh or open a new tab. Just keep the original video tab open so the session stays active."

    },
    {
      "question": "Is my activity private?",
      "answer": "All conversion happens locally, no analytics are collected, and the extension never sends your viewing history to external services."
