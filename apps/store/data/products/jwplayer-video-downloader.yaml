  JW Player Video Downloader unlocks the videos hiding behind jwplayer.com and jwplatform.com embeds used across newsrooms, OTT portals, and course platforms. The extension detects the player, resolves the signed media URLs, and saves a clean MP4 so you can review, archive, or edit content offline.

  From newsroom replays and subscriber-only interviews to customer education hubs, JW Player Video Downloader keeps teams in control of their media without reverse-engineering manifests or juggling third-party apps.

  benefits:
    - Keep JW Player news clips and interviews accessible when newsroom CMS

faqs:
  - question: Will it download videos from paywalled JW Player sites?
    answer: If you can watch the video in your browser, the downloader can save it.
      We reuse your authenticated session and do not bypass paywalls you cannot
      access.
  - question: Does it handle playlists or channel feeds?
    answer: Yes. Add the playlist to the queue and each item downloads in order with
      its own progress and retry controls.
  - question: Are DRM-protected streams supported?
    answer: DRM-protected JW Player configurations are not supported. Non-DRM MP4,
      HLS, and DASH renditions download normally.
  - question: Can I extract captions or subtitles?
    answer: The initial release focuses on video and audio. Closed caption downloads
      are planned for a future update based on waitlist feedback.
  - question: What happens if my connection drops mid-download?
    answer: The downloader keeps track of completed segments and resumes
      automatically when your connection returns, preventing corrupted files.
