  "description": "SERP Audio Downloader is the dedicated track and episode capture engine for people who need pristine masters from anywhere online. It fingerprints 1,000+ streaming, social, course, and podcast hosts, pulls the highest-quality rendition they expose—FLAC, WAV, 320kbps MP3, or AAC—and leaves you with clean, chapter-aware files ready for editing or archive.\n\nThe extension keeps a real-time manifest of supported providers, handles segmented HLS/DASH audio just as easily as progressive downloads, and merges multi-part shows without leaving stray gaps or channel drift. Teams can batch entire seasons, auto-normalise loudness to LKFS targets, and auto-fill ID3 artwork and metadata so the files are broadcast-ready the moment they land in storage.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Which platforms does SERP Audio Downloader support?",
      "answer": "The manifest covers 1,000+ verified sources spanning DSPs, podcast hosts, livestreamers, membership communities, and course platforms. New providers ship weekly without waiting on store approvals."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can it download entire podcast seasons or playlists?",
      "answer": "Yes. Queue full seasons, private RSS feeds, or branded playlists and the extension will parallelise downloads while respecting provider rate limits."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does audio stay lossless?",
      "answer": "When providers expose lossless FLAC or WAV renditions, SERP Audio Downloader grabs them. Otherwise it selects the highest bitrate available and never transcodes unless you apply a post-processing recipe."
    },
    {
      "question": "How are metadata and artwork handled?",
      "answer": "ID3v2 tags, embedded artwork, chapters, and cue sheets are pulled directly from the source manifest. You can customise templates so recurring fields—like show, season, or campaign IDs—stay consistent."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can teams collaborate?",
      "answer": "Teams can share recipe presets, monitor download progress on a central dashboard, and export audit logs so compliance reviews are simple."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about private or authenticated content?",
      "answer": "Bring your own cookies or headers, store them securely per provider, and SERP Audio Downloader reuses the session—if you can play the audio, you can save it."
