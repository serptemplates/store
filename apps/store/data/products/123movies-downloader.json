  "description": "123movies Downloader is a purpose-built Chrome extension that tracks down the hidden HLS streams powering 123movies mirrors and turns them into clean MP4 files. It recognises the moment a video starts playing, captures the source, and keeps quality identical to what you see online so buffering and pop-ups never ruin the copy you save.\n\nDownloads run in resilient chunks with automatic retries, making two-hour films as reliable as quick clips. A clear status bar walks through scanning, fetching, and merging so you always know whether the stream is still downloading or already processing the final MP4.\n\nActivation is handled with a simple email and lifetime licence key. After unlocking, just open a mirror, press play, and click Process Stream to watch the extension assemble a finished MP4 directly in your browser’s downloads folder without touching external servers.\n\nKeep the tab open while it works, remember that DRM-protected platforms stay off limits, and consider a dedicated browser profile if you prefer running high-permission extensions in their own space.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I save a movie with 123movies Downloader?",
      "answer": "Visit any 123movies mirror, play the video, click the extension icon, and choose Process Stream. It captures the stream in chunks, retries automatically if your connection hiccups, and delivers the finished MP4 directly to your downloads folder."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can it download DRM-protected or premium streaming services?",
      "answer": "No. The extension only works on open 123movies mirrors. Platforms that enforce DRM or encrypted streams remain inaccessible and the downloader will not bypass those protections."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it support multiple downloads at once?",
      "answer": "Downloads run one at a time so the extension can guarantee a clean MP4. Start the next video after the current progress bar finishes to avoid interrupted files."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the extension request so many permissions?",
      "answer": "123movies mirrors rely on redirect chains and hidden streams. Permissions like webRequest, webNavigation, scripting, and downloads let the extension locate the real video source, monitor progress, and save it locally while keeping your licence stored securely."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are compatible?",
      "answer": "It’s built for Chromium browsers including Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave, Opera, and similar variants, and it also ships with a Firefox build for users on Windows, macOS, and Linux."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a free trial or refund policy?",
      "answer": "The licence is a one-time $17 purchase with no free tier and no refunds. Updates for new mirror domains are included for existing customers."
    },
    {
