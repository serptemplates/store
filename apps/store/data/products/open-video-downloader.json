  "description": "Open Video Downloader gives creators, educators, and archivists a reliable way to capture Open.video streams for offline viewing or reference. It detects players on open.video pages, course portals, and embedded blog posts, then fetches every available rendition so you can grab the exact quality you need.\n\nAuthentication cookies, signed URLs, and segmented HLS playlists are handled under the hood—no command-line tooling or manual manifest wrangling required. Queue multiple episodes or live event replays, keep an eye on segment progress, and let the extension merge the stream into a single MP4 while you focus on the rest of your workflow.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Will Open Video Downloader work with private Open.video channels?",
      "answer": "If you can play the video in your browser while logged in, the downloader can capture it. We forward your existing session cookies instead of bypassing permissions you do not have."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can it download live event replays or long webinars?",
      "answer": "Yes. The extension processes segmented HLS streams, keeps track of the current segment, and stitches everything into a single MP4 even for multi-hour recordings."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I have to keep the tab open during downloads?",
      "answer": "Keep the original tab open until the progress bar completes. You can switch to other tabs or apps—the downloader continues working in the background."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it support batch downloads?",
      "answer": "Queue multiple Open.video URLs inside the extension. Each item gets its own progress indicator and can be paused, resumed, or re-ordered."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are captions or subtitles included?",
      "answer": "The first release focuses on video and audio capture. Subtitle export is on the roadmap and will arrive in a future update."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this legal?",
      "answer": "<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> We are not attorneys and do not offer legal advice. Laws vary by country and platform.
