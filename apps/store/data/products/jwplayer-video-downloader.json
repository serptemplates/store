  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Will it download videos from paywalled JW Player sites?",
      "answer": "If you can watch the video in your browser, the downloader can save it. We reuse your authenticated session and do not bypass paywalls you cannot access."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it handle playlists or channel feeds?",
      "answer": "Yes. Add the playlist to the queue and each item downloads in order with its own progress and retry controls."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are DRM-protected streams supported?",
      "answer": "DRM-protected JW Player configurations are not supported. Non-DRM MP4, HLS, and DASH renditions download normally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I extract captions or subtitles?",
      "answer": "The initial release focuses on video and audio. Closed caption downloads are planned for a future update based on waitlist feedback."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if my connection drops mid-download?",
      "answer": "The downloader keeps track of completed segments and resumes automatically when your connection returns, preventing corrupted files."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this legal?",
