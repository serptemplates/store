  Whop Video Downloader adds a download button to courses, drops, and members-only pages so you can save content before access expires. It uses your Whop login to read the Mux stream powering each player, downloads every segment with the proper headers, and merges the video into a standard MP4 for offline study.

faqs:
- question: How do I download a Whop video with this extension?
  answer: Log into Whop, open the page with the video, click the on-player download
    button or the extension popup, choose your quality, and let the progress bar finish.
    The MP4 will save automatically.
- question: Does it work with member-only content?
  answer: Yes. The downloader uses your Whop session to authenticate, so any video
    you can play in your account can be saved offline.
- question: Can I select different qualities?
  answer: When Whop provides multiple renditions, the popup lists them so you can
    pick the resolution that fits your storage and playback needs.
- question: Does it capture captions or additional materials?
  answer: The tool focuses on video and audio. Download other attachments separately
    from Whop if you need them.
- question: Which browsers are supported?
  answer: Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows,
    macOS, and Linux desktops.
- question: Do I need to keep the tab open while downloading?
  answer: Yes. Keep the Whop tab open so your authentication remains active while
    the extension retrieves each segment and merges the MP4.

    the progress bar keeps me in the loop.

permission_justifications:
- permission: downloads
  justification: |
    Saves the merged MP4 into your downloads folder and keeps the progress display
    accurate during conversion.
- permission: storage
  justification: |
    Stores licence activation and preferred quality locally so the downloader stays
    configured between sessions.
- permission: activeTab
  justification: |
    Detects Whop video players on the current tab and injects the download overlay
    button in the correct place.
- permission: tabs
  justification: |
    Allows downloads to continue if you navigate between course pages and restores
    the status panel when you return.
- permission: scripting
  justification: |
    Reads Whop’s player configuration, Mux manifests, and authentication headers to
    fetch the correct stream segments.
- permission: notifications
  justification: |
    Sends completion or error alerts so you know when a video finishes downloading
    without watching the popup.
- permission: contextMenus
  justification: |
    Adds a right-click “Download with Whop Video Downloader” option for quick saves
    from embedded players.
- permission: offscreen
  justification: |
    Merges Mux segments into MP4 files in the background, preventing the active tab
    from freezing during long downloads.
- permission: host_permissions
  justification: |
    Limits privileged access to whop.com and Whop’s video CDN hosts so the extension
    only touches pages required for downloads.
