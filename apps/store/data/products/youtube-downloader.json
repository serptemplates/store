  "description": "YouTube Video Downloader plugs into watch pages, Shorts, and embedded players, decrypts YouTube’s adaptive streams, and delivers high-quality MP4 or WebM files you can use offline.

  "status": "live",
  "features": [
    "Detects YouTube watch pages, Shorts, and embedded players instantly",
    "Download YouTube videos to MP4s",
    "Decrypts player responses to surface the original MP4 or WebM sources",
    "Converts DASH and HLS streams, merging audio and video into a single MP4",
    "Lists every available quality with file-size estimates and remembers your last pick",
    "Queues up to three downloads at once with live progress, speed, and ETA tracking",
    "Keeps downloads running in the background while you browse other tabs",
    "Generates ready-to-run yt-dlp commands for advanced workflows",
    "Stores license activation and preferences locally with zero analytics"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Does it work with YouTube Shorts and embedded players?",
      "answer": "Yes. The extension detects Shorts feeds, standard watch pages, and embedded players on third-party sites, then serves the same quality list in each case."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I download a livestream while it is broadcasting?",
      "answer": "The downloader supports livestream replays, but it needs the on-demand version to exist first. Once the replay is posted it converts the HLS stream into a single MP4."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will it download movies or episodes I purchased on YouTube?",
      "answer": "No. DRM-protected purchases remain off limits. The downloader only works on videos you can already view without digital rights management."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many downloads can run simultaneously?",
      "answer": "Up to three downloads can be active at once. Each item shows progress, speed, and an interrupt button so you can prioritise what matters."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do I need to keep the video tab open the whole time?",
      "answer": "For long conversions we recommend keeping the original tab open. That ensures the stream segments stay available until the MP4 is finalised."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
      "answer": "Chrome and Chromium-based browsers like Edge, Brave, and Opera are supported. Make sure you’re on an up-to-date build for Manifest V3 compatibility."
    },

      "question": "Is this legal?",
