faqs:
  - question: Can I download all content from Patreon creators I support?
    answer: Yes! Download all posts, videos, images, audio files, and attachments
      from your supported creators. The tool organizes content by creator and
      tier level, ensuring you have everything you've paid for.
  - question: Does it work with exclusive patron-only content?
    answer: Absolutely! Download exclusive content from the creator tiers you're
      subscribed to. This includes patron-only posts, behind-the-scenes content,
      early access releases, and members-only downloads.
  - question: What if creators delete posts or leave Patreon?

      content or delete their Patreon entirely. By archiving content locally,
      you keep permanent access to everything you've supported financially.
  - question: Can I download attached files like PDFs, PSD files, and ZIP archives?
    answer: Yes! The downloader saves all file types including documents, project
      files, source materials, and compressed archives. Perfect for patrons of
      artists, educators, and creators who share digital resources.
  - question: Does it handle Patreon's audio and video podcasts?
    answer: Yes! Download podcast episodes, video content, and audio files in their
      original quality. Great for offline listening and ensuring you don't miss
      content if you need to pause your subscription temporarily.
