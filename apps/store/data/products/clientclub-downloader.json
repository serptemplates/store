  "description": "ClientClub Downloader keeps agency training and community lessons within reach even after access expires. It recognises native ClientClub uploads alongside embedded videos from YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, Loom, and GoHighLevel, presenting everything inside one popup so you can grab the exact lesson you need.\n\nPick the rendition you prefer, queue up to three downloads at once, and let the global progress panel track stage, speed, and ETA while background workers merge adaptive streams into MP4s. The extension relies on your existing ClientClub session, stores settings locally, and sends a desktop alert the moment a file is ready for offline study.",
