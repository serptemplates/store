faqs:
  - question: Can I download videos from Facebook Watch and Reels?
    answer: Yes! Download videos from Facebook Watch, Reels, regular posts, and
      stories. Works with public content and posts from friends or groups you're
      part of.
  - question: Does it save videos from private groups and pages I'm in?
    answer: Yes, as long as you have permission to view the content through your
      Facebook account. The downloader accesses content just like your browser
      would while logged in.
  - question: Can I download live streams and recorded broadcasts?
    answer: Yes! Record live streams as they happen or download them after they
      finish. Perfect for saving important broadcasts, events, or content that
      might not stay available forever.
  - question: What quality options are available for Facebook downloads?
    answer: Download in the highest quality available for each video, typically up
      to 1080p HD. Facebook compresses uploads, but our downloader gets the best
      version available on the platform.
  - question: How does this help with content archiving?
    answer: Facebook content frequently disappearsâ€”accounts get deleted, videos are
      removed, or privacy settings change. Our downloader helps you preserve
      important memories, educational content, or business assets before they're
      gone.
