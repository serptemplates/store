faqs:
  - question: How do I download content from Facebook?
    answer: To download Facebook content, you can use browser extensions, online downloaders, or dedicated software. However, always respect the platform's terms of service and content creators' rights. Only download content you have permission to save.
  - question: Is it legal to download Facebook posts and media?
    answer: The legality depends on copyright ownership and platform terms. Generally, you can save your own content, but downloading others' content without permission may violate copyright and platform policies. Public domain content and content with explicit download permissions are typically safe.
  - question: Can I download Facebook stories before they expire?
    answer: While technically possible with third-party tools, downloading Facebook stories may violate the platform's terms of service and the creator's privacy expectations. Stories are designed to be temporary, and saving them without permission is generally not recommended.
  - question: What quality can I expect from Facebook downloads?
    answer: Facebook download quality depends on the original upload quality and the downloader used. Most tools preserve the original quality, but some may compress files. Look for downloaders that offer quality options and support high-resolution downloads.
  - question: How do I download Facebook videos in bulk?
    answer: Some Facebook downloaders support bulk downloading of multiple videos at once. Look for tools that allow batch downloads or playlist downloads. However, be mindful of rate limits and respect the platform's terms of service to avoid account restrictions.
  - question: Are there any risks in using Facebook downloaders?
    answer: 'Potential risks include: 1) Account suspension for violating terms of service, 2) Malware from untrusted downloader software, 3) Privacy concerns with third-party tools, 4) Legal issues if downloading copyrighted content. Always use reputable tools and respect content creators'' rights.'
  - question: Can I download private Facebook content?
    answer: You should not attempt to download private Facebook content that you don't have permission to access. This violates privacy expectations and platform terms of service. Only download publicly available content or content you've created yourself.
  - question: What formats do Facebook downloads support?
    answer: Facebook downloaders typically support common formats like MP4 for videos, JPG/PNG for images, and MP3 for audio. The available formats depend on the original content type and the downloader software used. Choose formats compatible with your intended use.
