faqs:
  - question: How does this downloader help manage my Shutterstock subscription?
    answer: Our tool streamlines bulk downloads, tracks which images you've already
      downloaded, and organizes files by collection or project. Perfect for
      agencies and creators who download hundreds of assets monthly and need
      efficient workflow management.
  - question: Can I download Shutterstock videos and music, not just images?
    answer: Yes! The downloader works with Shutterstock's entire library including
      images, vectors, videos, and music tracks. You can batch download mixed
      media types and organize them by project for efficient asset management.
  - question: Does it preserve metadata and licensing information?
    answer: Absolutely! All image metadata, keywords, and license details are
      preserved with each download. This makes it easy to track usage rights,
      find similar images later, and maintain compliance with licensing terms.
  - question: Can I download images at multiple sizes at once?
    answer: Yes! Select multiple resolution options and download the same image in
      different sizes with one click. Great for having both web-optimized and
      print-ready versions without manual re-downloads.
  - question: How does it help with client projects and team workflows?
    answer: Organize downloads into project folders, share collections with team
      members, and maintain consistent file naming. The tool integrates with
      your existing workflow and makes collaborative stock asset management
      effortless.
