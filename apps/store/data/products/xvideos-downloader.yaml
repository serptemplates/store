faqs:
- question: How do I download an XVideos video with reliable results?
  answer: Open the video on any XVideos domain, click the downloader icon, choose
    your preferred quality, and let the extension handle the rest. It applies the
    correct headers automatically so the MP4 saves without error.
- question: Does it work on regional mirrors like xvideos.es?
  answer: Yes. The extension supports xvideos.com, xvideos.es, and other official
    mirrors with no extra configuration.
- question: Can I download multiple videos simultaneously?
  answer: Downloads run one at a time so each file completes successfully. Start the
    next video after the current one finishes.
- question: Which browsers are supported?
  answer: Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows,
    macOS, and Linux desktops.
- question: Does it remove watermarks or change the file?
  answer: No. The downloader saves the original MP4 exactly as XVideos delivers it—no
    re-encoding or watermark removal is performed.
- question: Is my activity private?
  answer: All operations happen locally. The extension only validates your licence
    and never uploads viewing or download history.
