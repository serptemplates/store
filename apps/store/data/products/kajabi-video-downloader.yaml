  Kajabi Video Downloader lets you own the lessons you already paid for. It recognises Kajabi’s hosted videos along with Vimeo and Wistia embeds inside lessons, queues as many modules as you need, and converts every stream into organised MP4 files you can keep forever.

  Queue a module, and the extension will pull each lesson sequentially, respecting throttle limits, merging adaptive streams, and storing subtitles alongside the video. Smart file naming mirrors your course structure so your library is sorted the moment downloads finish.

  Everything runs in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, or Opera using your existing Kajabi login, with processing kept entirely on your device for privacy-conscious archiving.

  - Avoid recurring platform fees by owning videos you already purchased
faqs:
- question: How do I queue multiple Kajabi lessons?
  answer: Open the course, click the Kajabi Downloader icon, add the lessons you want
    to the queue, and let the extension process them sequentially while you continue
    browsing.
- question: Does it download subtitles and transcripts?
  answer: If a lesson offers WebVTT captions, the downloader saves them alongside
    the MP4 and can optionally merge them, keeping accessibility intact.
- question: Will it work on membership or coaching portals?
  answer: Yes. It uses your current Kajabi session, so as long as you can watch the
    content in your account, the downloader can capture it—even on custom domains.
- question: Can I download multiple lessons in parallel?
  answer: To avoid platform throttling, the queue runs lessons one after another.
    You can stack as many as you like, but they’ll process sequentially.
- question: Which browsers are supported?
  answer: Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows,
    macOS, and Linux. Safari and mobile browsers are not supported.
- question: Why does it request offscreen access?
  answer: Offscreen processing merges adaptive stream segments into cohesive MP4 files
    without freezing the active course tab.
- question: Is my data private?
  answer: All detection and conversion happen locally. The extension only contacts
    the licence server for activation and never stores passwords or viewing history.

  review: I queued every module from three courses and now have organised folders
    with subtitles. No more paying monthly just to rewatch old lessons.

  review: I select a module, hit queue, and let it work while I’m on calls. The throttle
    protection means it never stalls out mid-download.

  review: My favourite creator moved platforms and I still have every video thanks
    to this tool. The automatic naming is a huge bonus.
