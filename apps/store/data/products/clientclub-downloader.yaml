description: 'ClientClub Downloader keeps agency training and community lessons within
  reach even after access expires. It recognises native ClientClub uploads alongside
  embedded videos from YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, Loom, and GoHighLevel, presenting everything
  inside one popup so you can grab the exact lesson you need.


  Pick the rendition you prefer, queue up to three downloads at once, and let the
  global progress panel track stage, speed, and ETA while background workers merge
  adaptive streams into MP4s. The extension relies on your existing ClientClub session,
  stores settings locally, and sends a desktop alert the moment a file is ready for
  offline study.

  review: We download every ClientClub workshop before the cohort ends. Embedded Loom
    and Vimeo recordings show up together and the queue runs three at a time.
