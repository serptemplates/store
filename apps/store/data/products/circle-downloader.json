  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What videos can I download?",
      "answer": "Circle Downloader captures Circle native video uploads and embedded players from YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, and Loom. You can download content from any Circle post you have access to—including member-only and private community posts. The extension automatically detects all available media when you're viewing a post and displays them in the popup."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I download member-only or private content?",
      "answer": "Yes. If you can view the post in Circle, the extension can download it using your existing Circle login. You don't need separate credentials—authentication happens automatically in the background. This works for private communities, restricted posts, and member-exclusive lessons."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many videos can I download at once?",
      "answer": "You can run up to 3 simultaneous downloads. Additional videos are added to an automatic queue that starts processing as soon as a download slot opens up. This keeps your device responsive while letting you batch-queue an entire lesson series or week's worth of recordings."
    },
    {
      "question": "What quality options are available?",
      "answer": "Circle Downloader displays every quality rendition provided by the video source. Each option shows the resolution, bitrate, and estimated file size so you can choose based on your storage space and bandwidth. The extension remembers your quality preference and applies it to future downloads automatically."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does downloading preserve the original quality?",
      "answer": "Yes. For adaptive streams (HLS/DASH), the extension downloads segments and merges them into a single MP4 file without re-encoding. This means you get the exact quality provided by the platform with zero loss. Direct MP4 uploads are saved at full quality instantly."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where do my downloaded files go?",
      "answer": "You can choose any folder on your computer. The extension lets you set a default download location, and you can override it for individual downloads. Files are saved with clean, descriptive titles that make them easy to find and organize."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will this work if I'm offline?",
      "answer": "Yes, once videos are downloaded and saved to your computer, you can watch them anytime without an internet connection. However, you need to be online to authenticate with Circle and initiate downloads. The actual download process uses your internet, but playback is completely offline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
      "answer": "Circle Downloader works on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera. It's available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. If you're using a Chromium-based browser like Arc or Vivaldi, it should work as well."
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know when a download is complete?",
      "answer": "The extension sends desktop notifications when each video finishes downloading. You'll also see the status update in the progress panel. The notification tells you the video name and lets you quickly open the file or folder."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a free trial?",
      "answer": "Circle Downloader is a paid extension with no free trial period. Once purchased, you get lifetime access with all future updates included. All sales are final, but we stand behind the product and include email support."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about my privacy?",
      "answer": "All processing happens locally on your device. Nothing is sent to external servers except the download requests to the original video hosts (Circle, YouTube, Vimeo, etc.). Your Circle login credentials are never shared. Download history and preferences are stored only in your browser."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this legal?",
      "answer": "<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> We are not attorneys and do not offer legal advice. Laws vary by country and platform. For any legal question please consult a qualified legal professional.</p>\n<p>We give you full control over download speeds because we believe users should decide how they use their software.</p>\n<p>That said, here are a few widely accepted best practices for safe, responsible downloading:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Only download content you created, own, or have explicit permission from the rights holder to access.</li>\n<li>Protect your personal data by respecting platform rules and rate limits with reasonable download speeds to avoid automated abuse systems putting your account at risk.</li>\n<li>Protect your privacy by using a reputable VPN for IP protection before initiating downloads — <a href=\"https://serp.ly/best/vpn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this is the VPN we recommend &amp; use</a>.</li>\n</ol>"
