  "description": "Circle Downloader keeps community lessons and cohort recordings alive long after the posts disappear. It recognises both native Circle uploads and embedded players from YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, and Loom, then lets you save them as clean MP4 files without juggling separate tools.\n\nThe extension lists every quality rendition, labels the stream type, and remembers your preferred resolution for the next download. You can run up to three downloads at the same time, keep the global progress manager pinned while you browse, and queue additional videos that start automatically when a slot opens up.\n\nEverything happens with your existing Circle login inside the browser. Adaptive streams download chunk by chunk with retries and merge in the background, while direct MP4 uploads land instantly in the folder you choose. Notifications confirm when files are ready so you can archive resources, flight-proof course material, or revisit cohort calls offline.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Which video platforms does Circle Downloader support?",
      "answer": "It captures Circle native uploads and embedded players from YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, and Loom. Everything it detects appears in the popup with labels so you always know which source you are saving."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I download several lessons at the same time?",
      "answer": "Yes. Up to three downloads run concurrently. Additional videos wait in a queue and start automatically when a slot opens, so you can line up a batch of lessons and let the downloader work through them."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it keep the original quality of adaptive streams?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. You can pick any rendition the community provides. HLS and DASH sources download segment by segment and merge into an MP4 without re-encoding, preserving the original bitrate."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will it download member-only or private community content?",
      "answer": "If you can view the post in Circle, the extension can download it. It uses your existing Circle authentication and never asks for separate credentials."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a free trial or refund option?",
      "answer": "The extension requires a paid licence with no free tier and all sales are final. Updates for new Circle player changes are included."
    },

      "question": "Which browsers and operating systems are supported?",
