faqs:
  - question: How do I download content from Telegram?
    answer: To download Telegram content, you can use browser extensions, online
      downloaders, or dedicated software. However, always respect the platform's
      terms of service and content creators' rights. Only download content you
      have permission to save.
  - question: Is it legal to download Telegram posts and media?
    answer: The legality depends on copyright ownership and platform terms.
      Generally, you can save your own content, but downloading others' content
      without permission may violate copyright and platform policies. Public
      domain content and content with explicit download permissions are
      typically safe.
  - question: Can I download Telegram stories before they expire?
    answer: While technically possible with third-party tools, downloading Telegram
      stories may violate the platform's terms of service and the creator's
      privacy expectations. Stories are designed to be temporary, and saving
      them without permission is generally not recommended.
  - question: What quality can I expect from Telegram downloads?
    answer: Telegram download quality depends on the original upload quality and the
      downloader used. Most tools preserve the original quality, but some may
      compress files. Look for downloaders that offer quality options and
      support high-resolution downloads.
  - question: How do I download Telegram videos in bulk?
    answer: Some Telegram downloaders support bulk downloading of multiple videos at
      once. Look for tools that allow batch downloads or playlist downloads.
      However, be mindful of rate limits and respect the platform's terms of
      service to avoid account restrictions.
  - question: Are there any risks in using Telegram downloaders?
    answer: "Potential risks include: 1) Account suspension for violating terms of
      service, 2) Malware from untrusted downloader software, 3) Privacy
      concerns with third-party tools, 4) Legal issues if downloading
      copyrighted content. Always use reputable tools and respect content
      creators' rights."
  - question: Can I download private Telegram content?
    answer: You should not attempt to download private Telegram content that you
      don't have permission to access. This violates privacy expectations and
      platform terms of service. Only download publicly available content or
      content you've created yourself.
  - question: What formats do Telegram downloads support?
    answer: Telegram downloaders typically support common formats like MP4 for
      videos, JPG/PNG for images, and MP3 for audio. The available formats
      depend on the original content type and the downloader software used.
      Choose formats compatible with your intended use.
