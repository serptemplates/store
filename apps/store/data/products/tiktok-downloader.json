  "description": "TikTok Downloader adds a download button directly onto videos in your For You feed, Following feed, profiles, and direct links. Click once and it saves the MP4 that TikTok already serves—no copying URLs, switching tabs, or risking shady sites—so you can keep inspiration, references, and deliverables offline.\n\nThe extension uses your logged-in session to detect playable videos, labels what can or cannot be saved, and downloads exactly what TikTok streams (watermarks included when TikTok requires them) while you keep scrolling.",

      "question": "How do I download a TikTok video with this extension?",

    },
    {
      "question": "Does it remove the TikTok watermark?",
      "answer": "The downloader saves exactly what TikTok serves. If TikTok applies a watermark, the saved video will include it."
    },

    },
    {
      "question": "Does it work with slideshows or image posts?",

      "question": "Is my account data private?",
