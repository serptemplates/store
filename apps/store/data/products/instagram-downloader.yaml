faqs:
  - question: Can I download Instagram Stories and Highlights before they expire?
    answer: Yes! Our Instagram downloader lets you save Stories, Highlights, Reels,
      and IGTV videos in their original quality. Stories can be archived before
      they disappear after 24 hours, preserving them permanently.
  - question: Does it work with private Instagram accounts I follow?
    answer: Yes, as long as you have access to view the private content through your
      Instagram account, our downloader can save it. You'll need to be logged in
      to your account that has permission to view the private profiles.
  - question: Can I download entire Instagram profiles or specific hashtags?
    answer: Absolutely! You can batch download all posts from a profile, specific
      hashtags, or even carousel posts with multiple images. The downloader
      organizes everything by user and date for easy management.
  - question: What's the maximum quality for Instagram downloads?
    answer: The downloader preserves the original upload quality. For photos, this
      means full resolution images (typically up to 1080x1350 for posts). Videos
      are downloaded in the highest quality Instagram serves, usually 1080p HD.
  - question: Does it save post captions and comments?
    answer: Yes! Along with the media files, you can optionally save post captions,
      hashtags, and location data. This is perfect for archiving content with
      its full context and metadata.
