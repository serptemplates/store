faqs:
  - question: Can I download past Twitch broadcasts and VODs?
    answer: Yes! Download past broadcasts (VODs) before they expire. Twitch deletes
      VODs after 14-60 days depending on the streamer's status. Our tool
      archives them permanently in full quality.
  - question: Does it work with Twitch Clips and Highlights?
    answer: Absolutely! Download clips, highlights, and full streams. Perfect for
      content creators who want to edit Twitch content, or fans who want to keep
      favorite moments.
  - question: Can I download subscriber-only content?
    answer: If you're subscribed to a channel, you can download their
      subscriber-only VODs and content. Just log in with your Twitch account
      that has the appropriate subscriptions.
  - question: Does it support downloading live streams in real-time?
    answer: Yes! Record live streams as they happen in case the streamer doesn't
      save them as VODs. You'll never miss content from streams that aren't
      archived.
  - question: How does chat archiving work?
    answer: The downloader can optionally save chat logs alongside videos,
      preserving the full stream experience including viewer reactions and
      interactions. Great for streamers who want to review audience engagement.
