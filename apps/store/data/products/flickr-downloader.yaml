faqs:
  - question: How do I download content from Flickr?
    answer: To download Flickr content, you can use browser extensions, online
      downloaders, or dedicated software. However, always respect the platform's
      terms of service and content creators' rights. Only download content you
      have permission to save.
  - question: Is it legal to download Flickr posts and media?
    answer: The legality depends on copyright ownership and platform terms.
      Generally, you can save your own content, but downloading others' content
      without permission may violate copyright and platform policies. Public
      domain content and content with explicit download permissions are
      typically safe.
  - question: Can I download Flickr stories before they expire?
    answer: While technically possible with third-party tools, downloading Flickr
      stories may violate the platform's terms of service and the creator's
      privacy expectations. Stories are designed to be temporary, and saving
      them without permission is generally not recommended.
  - question: What quality can I expect from Flickr downloads?
    answer: Flickr download quality depends on the original upload quality and the
      downloader used. Most tools preserve the original quality, but some may
      compress files. Look for downloaders that offer quality options and
      support high-resolution downloads.
  - question: How do I download Flickr videos in bulk?
    answer: Some Flickr downloaders support bulk downloading of multiple videos at
      once. Look for tools that allow batch downloads or playlist downloads.
      However, be mindful of rate limits and respect the platform's terms of
      service to avoid account restrictions.
  - question: Are there any risks in using Flickr downloaders?
    answer: "Potential risks include: 1) Account suspension for violating terms of
      service, 2) Malware from untrusted downloader software, 3) Privacy
      concerns with third-party tools, 4) Legal issues if downloading
      copyrighted content. Always use reputable tools and respect content
      creators' rights."
  - question: Can I download private Flickr content?
    answer: You should not attempt to download private Flickr content that you don't
      have permission to access. This violates privacy expectations and platform
      terms of service. Only download publicly available content or content
      you've created yourself.
  - question: What formats do Flickr downloads support?
    answer: Flickr downloaders typically support common formats like MP4 for videos,
      JPG/PNG for images, and MP3 for audio. The available formats depend on the
      original content type and the downloader software used. Choose formats
      compatible with your intended use.
