faqs:
- question: How do I download content from Flickr?
  answer: To download Flickr content, you can use browser extensions, online downloaders,
    or dedicated software. However, always respect the platform's terms of service
    and content creators' rights. Only download content you have permission to save.
- question: Is it legal to download Flickr posts and media?
  answer: The legality depends on copyright ownership and platform terms. Generally,
    you can save your own content, but downloading others' content without permission
    may violate copyright and platform policies. Public domain content and content
    with explicit download permissions are typically safe.
- question: Can I download Flickr stories before they expire?
  answer: While technically possible with third-party tools, downloading Flickr stories
    may violate the platform's terms of service and the creator's privacy expectations.
    Stories are designed to be temporary, and saving them without permission is generally
    not recommended.
- question: What quality can I expect from Flickr downloads?
  answer: Flickr download quality depends on the original upload quality and the downloader
    used. Most tools preserve the original quality, but some may compress files. Look
    for downloaders that offer quality options and support high-resolution downloads.
- question: How do I download Flickr videos in bulk?
  answer: Some Flickr downloaders support bulk downloading of multiple videos at once.
    Look for tools that allow batch downloads or playlist downloads. However, be mindful
    of rate limits and respect the platform's terms of service to avoid account restrictions.
- question: Are there any risks in using Flickr downloaders?
  answer: 'Potential risks include: 1) Account suspension for violating terms of service,
    2) Malware from untrusted downloader software, 3) Privacy concerns with third-party
    tools, 4) Legal issues if downloading copyrighted content. Always use reputable
    tools and respect content creators'' rights.'
- question: Can I download private Flickr content?
  answer: You should not attempt to download private Flickr content that you don't
    have permission to access. This violates privacy expectations and platform terms
    of service. Only download publicly available content or content you've created
    yourself.
- question: What formats do Flickr downloads support?
  answer: Flickr downloaders typically support common formats like MP4 for videos,
    JPG/PNG for images, and MP3 for audio. The available formats depend on the original
    content type and the downloader software used. Choose formats compatible with
    your intended use.
