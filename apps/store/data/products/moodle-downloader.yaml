faqs:
  - question: How can I download Moodle courses for offline viewing?
    answer: "To download Moodle courses, you typically need: 1) An active
      subscription or course purchase, 2) Official Moodle mobile app (if
      available for offline viewing), 3) Third-party tools (use with caution).
      Always check Moodle's terms of service and only download content you've
      legitimately purchased or have access to."
  - question: Is it allowed to download Moodle course content?
    answer: Downloading Moodle courses is subject to the platform's terms of service
      and copyright laws. Most educational platforms allow offline viewing
      through their official apps but prohibit redistribution or sharing. Always
      respect intellectual property rights and only download content you've
      purchased or have legitimate access to.
  - question: What formats do Moodle course downloads come in?
    answer: Moodle course downloads typically come in MP4 format for videos, and may
      include PDF files for course materials, subtitles in SRT format, and audio
      files in MP3 format. The exact formats depend on the original content and
      the downloader used.
  - question: Can I download Moodle courses to multiple devices?
    answer: This depends on Moodle's licensing terms. Many platforms allow downloads
      to a limited number of devices per account. Check your subscription
      details and the platform's device limits. Using third-party downloaders
      may violate terms of service.
  - question: How do I organize downloaded Moodle course materials?
    answer: "Best practices for organizing downloaded Moodle courses: 1) Create
      folders by course name and instructor, 2) Maintain original file names
      when possible, 3) Include course descriptions and syllabi, 4) Back up
      important courses, 5) Use media management software for better
      organization."
