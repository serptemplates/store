faqs:
- question: How can I download Moodle courses for offline viewing?
  answer: 'To download Moodle courses, you typically need: 1) An active subscription
    or course purchase, 2) Official Moodle mobile app (if available for offline viewing),
    3) Third-party tools (use with caution). Always check Moodle''s terms of service
    and only download content you''ve legitimately purchased or have access to.'
- question: Is it allowed to download Moodle course content?
  answer: Downloading Moodle courses is subject to the platform's terms of service
    and copyright laws. Most educational platforms allow offline viewing through their
    official apps but prohibit redistribution or sharing. Always respect intellectual
    property rights and only download content you've purchased or have legitimate
    access to.
- question: What formats do Moodle course downloads come in?
  answer: Moodle course downloads typically come in MP4 format for videos, and may
    include PDF files for course materials, subtitles in SRT format, and audio files
    in MP3 format. The exact formats depend on the original content and the downloader
    used.
- question: Can I download Moodle courses to multiple devices?
  answer: This depends on Moodle's licensing terms. Many platforms allow downloads
    to a limited number of devices per account. Check your subscription details and
    the platform's device limits. Using third-party downloaders may violate terms
    of service.
- question: How do I organize downloaded Moodle course materials?
  answer: 'Best practices for organizing downloaded Moodle courses: 1) Create folders
    by course name and instructor, 2) Maintain original file names when possible,
    3) Include course descriptions and syllabi, 4) Back up important courses, 5) Use
    media management software for better organization.'
