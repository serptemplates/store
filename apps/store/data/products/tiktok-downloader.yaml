faqs:
- question: How do I download a TikTok video with this extension?
  answer: Browse TikTok normally. When you see the download icon on a video, click
    it and the MP4 will save directly to your downloads folder while you keep scrolling.
- question: Does it remove the TikTok watermark?
  answer: The downloader saves exactly what TikTok serves. If TikTok applies a watermark,
    the saved video will include it.
- question: Can I download private or restricted content?
  answer: "You can only download videos you can already watch with your account. The\
    \ extension uses your authenticated session and respects TikTok\u2019s access\
    \ controls."
- question: Does it work with slideshows or image posts?
  answer: No. The extension recognises slideshows or non-video posts and indicates
    that they cannot be downloaded.
- question: Which browsers are supported?
  answer: Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows,
    macOS, and Linux desktops.
- question: Can I queue multiple downloads?
  answer: Downloads are initiated one at a time. Click the download icon on each video
    you want to save.
- question: Is my account data private?
  answer: All detection and downloading happen locally. The extension never stores
    or transmits your credentials and only checks your licence status.
