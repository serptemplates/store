faqs:
  - question: Is this downloader necessary if Unsplash images are free?
    answer: Yes! While Unsplash is free, our downloader adds bulk download
      capabilities, collection management, automatic attribution tracking, and
      organization features. Download entire curated collections instantly
      instead of one-by-one through the website.
  - question: Can I download entire Unsplash collections or user galleries?
    answer: Absolutely! Save entire collections, user portfolios, or curated
      galleries with one click. All images are downloaded in full resolution and
      organized by collection name for easy browsing and use in projects.
  - question: Does it track photographer attribution for me?
    answer: Yes! The downloader automatically saves photographer credits and creates
      attribution files for each image. This makes it easy to give proper credit
      in your projects, which is appreciated even though Unsplash doesn't
      require it.
  - question: Can I search and download by keywords or themes?
    answer: Yes! Use keyword search to find and bulk download all matching images.
      Perfect for building themed stock libraries for specific projects or
      creating mood boards without manual searching.
  - question: How does this compare to right-clicking to save images?
    answer: Our tool is exponentially faster for multiple images, preserves full
      resolution (not the web-optimized version), saves metadata, tracks what
      you've downloaded, and organizes everything automatically. Manual saving
      becomes tedious after the first few images.
