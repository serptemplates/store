faqs:
- question: How do I download images from Unsplash?
  answer: Simply copy the image URL or post link from Unsplash, paste it into the downloader, and click download. The image will be saved to your computer in its original quality within seconds.
- question: Can I download images in bulk?
  answer: Yes! The batch download feature allows you to download multiple images, entire galleries, or even whole user profiles at once. This is perfect for creating collections or backups of Unsplash content.
- question: Does this preserve the original image quality?
  answer: Absolutely! The downloader fetches the highest resolution version available from Unsplash. Images are saved without any compression or quality degradation, giving you pristine originals.

  answer: The downloader supports all common formats including JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, and more. You can also convert images to different formats during download if needed.

  answer: If Unsplash content includes watermarks, the downloader saves images as they appear. For watermark-free downloads, ensure you have proper licenses or download your own content.
