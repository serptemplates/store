description: 'Redtube Video Downloader captures scenes from redtube.com, regional
  sites, and embedded players, converting them into MP4 files you can watch offline.
  It detects every available resolution, handles HLS streams behind the page, and
  keeps downloads moving even when you minimise the tab.


  Choose the quality you want, let the extension pull the stream segments, and it
  merges them in the background while you browse. The result is a clean MP4 saved
  locally with no ads, buffering, or tracking.

faqs:
- question: How do I download a Redtube video?
  answer: Open the video, click the downloader icon, pick your preferred resolution,
    and let the progress bar finish. The MP4 saves to your downloads folder with the
    video title.
- question: Does it work on embedded Redtube players?
  answer: Yes. The extension detects embed.redtube.com players and operates exactly
    the same as it does on the main site.
- question: Will it keep downloading if I reload the page?
  answer: Progress persists even if you refresh or open a new tab. Just keep the original
    video tab open so the session stays active.
- question: Which browsers are supported?
  answer: Versions are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows,
    macOS, and Linux desktops.
- question: Does it capture captions or interactive overlays?
  answer: "The downloader focuses on video and audio. Captions, overlays, or interactive\
    \ elements aren\u2019t included in the MP4."
- question: Is my activity private?
  answer: All conversion happens locally, no analytics are collected, and the extension
    never sends your viewing history to external services.

  review: Regional sites used to break other tools. This handles them all and the
    MP4s look identical to the site.
