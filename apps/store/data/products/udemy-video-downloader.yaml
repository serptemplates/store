faqs:
  - question: Can I download Udemy courses I've purchased for offline learning?
    answer: Yes! Our Udemy downloader lets you download all your purchased courses
      including videos, resources, quizzes, and subtitles. Everything is
      organized by section and lecture, making offline learning seamless.
  - question: Does it download course materials like PDFs and attachments?
    answer: Absolutely! Along with video lectures, the downloader saves all
      supplemental materials including PDFs, source code files, attachments, and
      subtitles in all available languages. You get the complete course package.
  - question: Will this work if Udemy updates their platform?
    answer: Yes, we provide lifetime updates to ensure compatibility. Whenever Udemy
      makes changes, we update the downloader within days. You'll never lose
      access to your purchased courses due to platform changes.
  - question: Can I download courses in bulk to save time?
    answer: Yes! Add multiple courses to the queue and let the downloader work
      automatically. It handles authentication, organizes files by course
      structure, and even resumes interrupted downloads if your connection
      drops.
  - question: What if my Udemy access expires or courses get removed?
    answer: That's exactly why our downloader exists. By archiving your purchased
      courses locally, you maintain permanent access even if Udemy removes
      content, instructors delete courses, or your subscription ends. Your
      learning library stays yours forever.
