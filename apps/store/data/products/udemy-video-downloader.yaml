faqs:
  - question: How can I download Udemy courses for offline viewing?
    answer: "To download Udemy courses, you typically need: 1) An active
      subscription or course purchase, 2) Official Udemy mobile app (if
      available for offline viewing), 3) Third-party tools (use with caution).
      Always check Udemy's terms of service and only download content you've
      legitimately purchased or have access to."
  - question: Is it allowed to download Udemy course content?
    answer: Downloading Udemy courses is subject to the platform's terms of service
      and copyright laws. Most educational platforms allow offline viewing
      through their official apps but prohibit redistribution or sharing. Always
      respect intellectual property rights and only download content you've
      purchased or have legitimate access to.
  - question: What formats do Udemy course downloads come in?
    answer: Udemy course downloads typically come in MP4 format for videos, and may
      include PDF files for course materials, subtitles in SRT format, and audio
      files in MP3 format. The exact formats depend on the original content and
      the downloader used.
  - question: Can I download Udemy courses to multiple devices?
    answer: This depends on Udemy's licensing terms. Many platforms allow downloads
      to a limited number of devices per account. Check your subscription
      details and the platform's device limits. Using third-party downloaders
      may violate terms of service.
  - question: How do I organize downloaded Udemy course materials?
    answer: "Best practices for organizing downloaded Udemy courses: 1) Create
      folders by course name and instructor, 2) Maintain original file names
      when possible, 3) Include course descriptions and syllabi, 4) Back up
      important courses, 5) Use media management software for better
      organization."
