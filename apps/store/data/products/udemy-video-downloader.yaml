  benefits:
  - Preserve entire Udemy courses for offline study or compliance archives
  - Keep videos, captions, and resources organised exactly like the course curriculum
  - Avoid throttling surprises with automatic pause/resume logic
faqs:
- question: How do I start downloading a Udemy course?
  answer: Log into Udemy, open the course curriculum, launch the downloader, choose
    the sections or lectures you need, and start the queue. The extension uses your
    session cookies to fetch videos, captions, and resources.
- question: Does it handle Udemy rate limits automatically?
  answer: Yes. When the platform throttles requests the downloader pauses, waits the
    required interval, and resumes so your account stays in good standing.
- question: What files are saved with each lecture?
  answer: Each lecture can include the MP4 video, optional audio-only track, caption
    files in available languages, and any downloadable resources or attachments linked
    to that lecture.
- question: Can I choose specific sections instead of the whole course?
  answer: Absolutely. Queue entire courses, individual sections, or selected lectures
    with the quality and caption languages you prefer.
- question: Which browsers are supported?
  answer: Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows,
    macOS, and Linux desktops.
- question: Is my Udemy account information safe?
  answer: The extension relies on locally exported session cookies. Credentials are
    never stored or transmitted, and all downloads happen on your device.
