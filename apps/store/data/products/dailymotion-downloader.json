    {
      "question": "Can I download private videos?",
      "answer": "If you can watch the video in your browser (including logged-in or passworded videos you have access to), you can download it. If you cannot view it, you cannot download it."
    },
    {
      "question": "How many videos I can download?",
      "answer": "After purchasing the extension you have lifetime access to it and future upgrades—you can download as many videos as you want."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do you track what I download?",
      "answer": "No. Everything happens locally on your computer and is never sent to our servers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Where is the video saved?",
      "answer": "Videos save to whatever folder your browser uses for downloads (usually your Downloads folder unless you changed it)."
    },
    {
      "question": "How long does it take to download?",
      "answer": "It depends on the video length, resolution, and your connection speed. Short clips finish quickly; long or high-resolution videos take longer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my data private?",
      "answer": "All detection and conversion happen locally. Only licence checks touch remote servers, and no viewing history or passwords are stored."
