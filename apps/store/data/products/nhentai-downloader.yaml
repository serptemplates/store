faqs:
- question: How do I download a doujinshi?
  answer: Enter the NHentai code or open the gallery, then start the download to save
    all pages in order.
- question: Does it bypass restricted content?
  answer: No. You must already have permission to view the gallery according to NHentai
    policies.

    JSON file for cataloging.
- question: Are downloads compressed?

    so you can open them in any reader.
- question: Is usage tracked?
