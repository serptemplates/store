faqs:
  - question: Can I download Skillshare classes I'm enrolled in?
    answer: Yes! Download all video lessons, class projects, and resources from
      classes in your library. Perfect for learning offline or keeping access to
      valuable classes after your subscription ends.
  - question: Does it save class projects and community resources?
    answer: The downloader saves all video content, transcripts, and downloadable

  - question: What if Skillshare removes a class I've learned from?
    answer: This happens more often than you'd think. Instructors remove classes,
      content gets updated, or licensing changes occur. Our downloader ensures
      you keep permanent copies of classes you've invested time in learning.
  - question: Can I download classes in bulk to build a personal learning library?
    answer: Yes! Queue multiple classes and download them automatically. Build a
      curated library of skills and knowledge that's always accessible, even

    answer: Absolutely! Download any class you can access through your Skillshare
      account, including Originals, exclusive content, and classes from top
