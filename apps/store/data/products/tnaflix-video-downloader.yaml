faqs:
  - question: How do I download a TNAFlix video with this extension?
    answer: Open the video, click the downloader icon, choose your desired
      resolution, and keep the tab open while the progress bar completes. The
      MP4 will save automatically.

    answer: Yes. The extension recognises both tnaflix.com and www.tnaflix.com
      variations and handles categories across the site.
  - question: Can I download several videos at once?
    answer: Downloads run one at a time to keep progress accurate. Queue the next
      video after the current download finishes.

    answer: Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on
      Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops.

      it—no re-encoding or watermark removal.

permission_justifications:
  - permission: downloads
    justification: |-
      Required for downloading TNAFlix videos straight to the user's computer with progress tracking.

      Usage highlights:
      - `background-enhanced.js` initiates downloads via the Chrome Downloads API.
      - Download listeners monitor progress and state changes to keep the UI updated.
  - permission: activeTab
    justification: |-
      Needed to inspect the active tab so the extension can confirm the user is on a TNAFlix page and extract the correct video data.

      Usage highlights:
      - `popup.js` queries the active tab before enabling download controls.
      - Tab lookups feed content script messaging for video detection.
  - permission: storage
    justification: |-
      Persists activation state, license metadata, and extension preferences to keep premium features unlocked.

      Usage highlights:
      - `auth.js` saves and retrieves activation details (status, license key, email).
      - `popup.js` reads stored activation info during startup.
      - Extension settings leverage storage for configuration.
  - permission: notifications
    justification: |-
      Enables desktop notifications so users receive feedback about download completion, errors, or status changes.

      Usage highlights:
      - Download success and failure toasts notify users when actions finish.
      - Error notifications surface issues that require user attention.
  - permission: contextMenus
    justification: |-
      Allows the extension to add quick-download context menu actions on TNAFlix video pages.

      Usage highlights:
      - Right-click menu entries trigger immediate downloads from video pages.
  - permission: tabs
    justification: |-
      Supports tab messaging, querying, and opening helper pages needed for download workflows.

      Usage highlights:
      - `popup.js` sends messages to content scripts running within tabs.
      - Active tab queries drive video detection logic.
      - Help and documentation pages open in new tabs when requested.
  - permission: scripting
    justification: |-
      Provides a fallback mechanism to inject content scripts dynamically when automatic injection is unavailable.

      Usage highlights:
      - `popup.js` can inject the content script on demand to recover from loading issues.
      - Dynamic script injection ensures video extraction works across TNAFlix page variations.
