  SERP Downloader is the all-in-one browser extension for people who need the fastest path from “I’m watching it now” to “I have the file saved forever.” It recognises 1,000+ streaming, social, and file-hosting providers, unwraps whatever format they use—HLS, DASH, progressive MP4, WebM, audio-only, or zipped image galleries—and returns clean downloads that match the original quality.

  Under the hood the extension keeps an up-to-date provider manifest, smartly routes each request through the right extractor, and merges segmented media without the user touching a command line. Teams can queue bulk jobs, monitor state from a single dashboard, and store recipes for recurring tasks so the same workflow works for the next platform that pops up.

faqs:
- question: How many providers does SERP Downloader actually support?
  answer: The catalog tracks 1,000+ actively verified providers across streaming, social, course, and cloud file platforms. Every release ships with automated regression tests so the list keeps growing while existing sites stay compatible.
- question: Can I add my own private or niche platform?
  answer: Yes. You can define custom recipes with the URL patterns, headers, and extractor logic you need. Once saved, they appear in the same picker as the built-in providers.
- question: What happens when a site changes its player or manifests?
  answer: We monitor breaking changes with heartbeat tests, roll out extractor updates through the manifest service, and notify you in-app. Critical fixes can be pulled down without waiting for a full store review.
- question: Does it capture subtitles, chapters, or metadata?
  answer: Subtitle, chapter, and metadata scraping is built-in. The extension exports SRT/VTT tracks, chapter markers, and JSON sidecars so editors and translators can keep context intact.
- question: Are there download limits or throttling?
  answer: No artificial limits are imposed. SERP Downloader respects the provider’s rate limits and retries automatically, but you can queue as many jobs as your connection and storage allow.
- question: How does authentication work for members-only content?
  answer: The extension forwards your existing session cookies and can store per-provider auth headers securely. If you can view the content in your browser, SERP Downloader can pull the same files without bypassing permissions.
- question: Which operating systems and browsers are supported?
  answer: Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Firefox, and other Chromium-based browsers on Windows, macOS, and Linux are supported. Safari support is on the roadmap once Manifest V3 parity lands.
