  GoHighLevel Downloader is the all-in-one extension for agencies and students who need reliable copies of GoHighLevel trainings. It recognises native lessons, classroom recordings, community posts, and embedded videos from YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, and Loom—even on white-label domains—and presents every available quality with clear labels.

  Choose the rendition you want and the extension handles the rest: direct MP4s save instantly, while adaptive HLS or DASH streams download chunk by chunk and merge into a clean MP4 with progress, speed, and ETA visible the entire time. Right-click shortcuts and inline controls let you start downloads without leaving the lesson you are reviewing.

  Because everything runs inside your authenticated browser session, the tool follows GoHighLevel’s sub-account permissions, keeps content you paid for private, and stores licence data locally. It’s the fastest path to build offline training libraries for agency teams, travel days, or when access might change.

faqs:
- question: How do I download a GoHighLevel lesson?
  answer: Open the lesson, classroom recording, or community post, click the GoHighLevel
    Downloader icon, choose the quality you want, and keep the tab open while the
    progress bar completes. The MP4 will save with the course and lesson name.
- question: Does it capture white-label or custom domains?
  answer: Yes. The extension recognises agency sub-domains, custom white-label URLs,
    and funnel paths so long as you have access to the content in your GoHighLevel
    account.
- question: Can I download entire courses at once?
  answer: Downloads are started one video at a time. You can queue multiple lessons,
    but there’s no batch export or ZIP bundling for full courses.
- question: Does it keep captions or transcripts?
  answer: The downloader focuses on video and audio. Captions, transcripts, and attachments
    aren’t included, so plan to keep those separately if you need them.
- question: Which browsers are supported?
  answer: Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows,
    macOS, and Linux desktops. Safari and mobile browsers aren’t supported.
- question: Why does it request broad host permissions?
  answer: GoHighLevel frequently embeds third-party players and runs on custom domains.
    Host permissions cover those variations so the extension can detect and save every
    authorised video you can view.
- question: Is my data private?
  answer: Absolutely. Downloads happen inside your browser session and licence information
    stays on your machine. No passwords or viewing history are transmitted.
