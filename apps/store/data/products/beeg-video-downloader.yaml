permission_justifications:
- permission: downloads
  justification: |-
    Required for downloading Beeg videos directly to the user's device.

    Usage highlights:

    - `background-enhanced.js:285` launches new downloads via the API.
    - `background-enhanced.js:395` listens for download state and progress events.
    - `popup.js:228` finds download entries by ID to display progress in the popup.
- permission: activeTab
  justification: |-
    Needed to inspect and interact with the actively focused tab so the extension can validate Beeg pages and extract video data.

    Usage highlights:
    - `popup.js:30-33` checks whether the active tab is a Beeg page before enabling download controls.
    - `background-enhanced.js:80, 247` retrieves the active tab to coordinate download operations.
    - Multiple `chrome.tabs.sendMessage` calls communicate with content scripts running on the active tab.
- permission: storage
  justification: |-
    Persists activation status, license keys, and related account metadata locally to unlock paid features reliably.

    Usage highlights:
    - `auth.js` `saveActivation` stores activation flags, license keys, and associated emails.
    - `auth.js` `checkActivationStatus` restores stored activation information whenever the popup loads.
- permission: notifications
  justification: |-
    Allows the extension to show system notifications for download progress, completion, and error handling.

    Usage highlights:
    - `background-enhanced.js:426` creates notifications with `chrome.notifications.create`.
    - Lines 399-401, 406, 447-450, 454-457 send completion, failure, no-video-found, and wrong-site notices.
- permission: contextMenus
  justification: |-
    Lets the extension add a "Download Beeg Video" option to the browser's context menu on Beeg pages.

    Usage highlights:
    - `background-enhanced.js:10-18` registers the context menu entry through `chrome.contextMenus.create`.
    - `background-enhanced.js:22-30` handles menu clicks with `chrome.contextMenus.onClicked` to launch downloads.
- permission: tabs
  justification: |-
    Enables tab lookups, messaging, and helper tab creation required for coordinating downloads and showing history.

    Usage highlights:
    - `popup.js:30, 288` queries active tabs and opens new tabs for history views.
    - `background-enhanced.js:24, 80, 86, 138, 247, 253, 442` performs tab queries and content script messaging for download management.
