  "description": "Brightcove Video Downloader helps teams archive enterprise video portals, training libraries, and campaign landing pages powered by Brightcove. The extension recognises players served from players.brightcove.net and embedded marketing sites, then captures the underlying media streams with the access you already have.\n\nWhether you are preparing compliance backups, reviewing customer onboarding flows, or keeping stakeholders aligned during launches, Brightcove Video Downloader automates the process—no devtools spelunking, header tracing, or external CLI utilities required.",

  "seo_description": "Download Brightcove-hosted videos, gated trainings, and embedded marketing assets with the Brightcove Video Downloader extension.",
  "status": "pre_release",
  "features": [
    "Detects Brightcove players across players.brightcove.net, bcbolt.com, and embedded marketing pages",
    "Authenticates using your existing SSO or token-based Brightcove session to respect access controls",
    "Supports DRM-free progressive and adaptive HLS/DASH renditions with automatic MP4 merging",
    "Provides bitrate, resolution, and file size details so stakeholders can choose the right asset for handoffs",
    "Logs chapter markers, cue points, and metadata in a companion JSON file for internal documentation",
    "Batch downloads playlists or course modules with resumable transfers and retry logic",
    "Built for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, and Linux"
  ],
  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "Can Brightcove Video Downloader access SSO-protected portals?",
      "answer": "Yes. If you can view the video after authenticating with SSO, the downloader reuses that browser session to pull the stream. It never bypasses permissions you do not already have."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it work with the latest Brightcove player embeds?",
      "answer": "The extension recognises both classic and modern Brightcove player deployments, including inline and modal embeds on marketing sites."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are DRM-protected videos supported?",
      "answer": "Brightcove implementations that layer DRM (Widevine, PlayReady, FairPlay) are not supported. Non-DRM HLS and DASH streams download normally."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will captions or cue points be saved?",
      "answer": "Video and audio export in MP4 format. Cue points and chapter metadata are written to a companion JSON for reference. Subtitle packaging is on the roadmap."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I queue an entire playlist?",
      "answer": "Yes. Add multiple assets to the queue and the downloader will process them sequentially, keeping progress, retries, and final filenames organised."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this legal?",
      "answer": "<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> We are not attorneys and do not offer legal advice. Laws vary by country and platform. For any legal question please consult a qualified legal professional.</p>\n<p>We give you full control over download speeds because we believe users should decide how they use their software.</p>\n<p>That said, here are a few widely accepted best practices for safe, responsible downloading:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Only download content you created, own, or have explicit permission from the rights holder to access.</li>\n<li>Protect your personal data by respecting platform rules and rate limits with reasonable download speeds to avoid automated abuse systems putting your account at risk.</li>\n<li>Protect your privacy by using a reputable VPN for IP protection before initiating downloads — <a href=\"https://serp.ly/best/vpn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this is the VPN we recommend &amp; use</a>.</li>\n</ol>"
