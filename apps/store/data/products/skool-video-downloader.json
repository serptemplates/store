  "description": "Skool Video Downloader makes course lessons, community uploads, and classroom recordings available offline before access changes. It uses your active Skool login to detect videos, lists every resolution the platform provides, and converts the stream into a smooth MP4 without leaving the browser.  Queue a lesson, let the downloader fetch each segment with your authentication headers, and it will merge everything in the background while you continue studying. The result is a private MP4 library that mirrors what you can watch inside Skool.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I download a Skool lesson with this extension?",
      "answer": "Open the lesson, click the downloader icon, choose your quality, and keep the tab open while the segment counter completes. The MP4 will save with the community and lesson name."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it work with private communities or paid cohorts?",
      "answer": "Yes. The downloader uses your existing Skool session, so any video you can watch while logged in can be saved offline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I download multiple lessons at once?",
      "answer": "Downloads run one at a time to keep session tokens valid. Queue the next lesson after the current progress bar finishes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
      "answer": "Versions are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops. Safari is not supported."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do captions or attachments download too?",
      "answer": "Videos export as MP4 files. Captions, PDFs, or other attachments should be saved separately from within Skool."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I refresh the page?",
      "answer": "Progress persists. As long as the original tab remains open, the downloader resumes from the last segment and finishes the MP4."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my data private?",
      "answer": "All detection and conversion happen locally. Only licence checks touch remote servers, and no viewing history or passwords are stored."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this legal?",
      "answer": "<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> We are not attorneys and do not offer legal advice. Laws vary by country and platform. For any legal question please consult a qualified legal professional.</p>\n<p>We give you full control over download speeds because we believe users should decide how they use their software.</p>\n<p>That said, here are a few widely accepted best practices for safe, responsible downloading:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Only download content you created, own, or have explicit permission from the rights holder to access.</li>\n<li>Protect your personal data by respecting platform rules and rate limits with reasonable download speeds to avoid automated abuse systems putting your account at risk.</li>\n<li>Protect your privacy by using a reputable VPN for IP protection before initiating downloads — <a href=\"https://serp.ly/best/vpn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this is the VPN we recommend &amp; use</a>.</li>\n</ol>"
