faqs:
  - question: Can I download LinkedIn Learning courses for offline viewing?
    answer: Yes! Download entire courses including all chapters, transcripts, and
      exercise files. Perfect for professionals who want to learn during
      commutes or when internet access is limited.
  - question: Does it save exercise files and course resources?
    answer: Absolutely! All downloadable resources, exercise files, and
      supplementary materials are saved alongside videos. You get the complete
      learning experience offline.
  - question: What if my company's LinkedIn Learning access ends?
    answer: Many companies provide LinkedIn Learning access that expires when you
      leave. Our downloader lets you archive courses you've completed or want to
      reference later, preserving valuable professional development content.
  - question: Can I download certificates of completion?
    answer: While certificates are issued by LinkedIn Learning online, you can keep
      copies of course content to prove your learning. The downloaded materials
      serve as references for skills you've acquired.
  - question: Does it work with LinkedIn Learning's mobile content?
    answer: Our downloader accesses the same content as the website, typically in
      higher quality than mobile. You'll get full desktop-quality videos that
      work on any device, not limited by mobile app restrictions.
