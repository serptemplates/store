  "description": "Kajabi Video Downloader lets you own the lessons you already paid for. It recognises Kajabi’s hosted videos along with Vimeo and Wistia embeds inside lessons, queues as many modules as you need, and converts every stream into organised MP4 files you can keep forever.\n\nQueue a module, and the extension will pull each lesson sequentially, respecting throttle limits, merging adaptive streams, and storing subtitles alongside the video. Smart file naming mirrors your course structure so your library is sorted the moment downloads finish.\n\nEverything runs in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, or Opera using your existing Kajabi login, with processing kept entirely on your device for privacy-conscious archiving.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I queue multiple Kajabi lessons?",
      "answer": "Open the course, click the Kajabi Downloader icon, add the lessons you want to the queue, and let the extension process them sequentially while you continue browsing."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it download subtitles and transcripts?",
      "answer": "If a lesson offers WebVTT captions, the downloader saves them alongside the MP4 and can optionally merge them, keeping accessibility intact."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will it work on membership or coaching portals?",
      "answer": "Yes. It uses your current Kajabi session, so as long as you can watch the content in your account, the downloader can capture it—even on custom domains."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I download multiple lessons in parallel?",
      "answer": "To avoid platform throttling, the queue runs lessons one after another. You can stack as many as you like, but they’ll process sequentially."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
      "answer": "Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Safari and mobile browsers are not supported."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does it request offscreen access?",
      "answer": "Offscreen processing merges adaptive stream segments into cohesive MP4 files without freezing the active course tab."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my data private?",
      "answer": "All detection and conversion happen locally. The extension only contacts the licence server for activation and never stores passwords or viewing history."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this legal?",
      "answer": "<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> We are not attorneys and do not offer legal advice. Laws vary by country and platform.
