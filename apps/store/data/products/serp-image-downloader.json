  "description": "SERP Image Downloader is the all-format asset grabber for creative teams that need the fastest path from inspiration to organised library. It recognises 1,000+ stock sites, marketplaces, design tools, and social feeds, fetches original-resolution files—JPG, PNG, SVG, WebP, AVIF, sprites, and zipped collections—and hands you clean, deduplicated folders tagged with the metadata you care about.\n\nThe extension maintains a living provider manifest, unwraps complex gallery APIs, and stitches infinite-scrolling boards into tidy downloads without brittle manual scripts. Design ops teams can schedule bulk pulls, auto-map licensing metadata, and sync drops straight into DAM buckets while keeping everything on-device.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "What file formats can SERP Image Downloader capture?",
      "answer": "It pulls whatever the provider serves—raster formats like JPG, PNG, WebP, AVIF; scalable assets like SVG and EPS; sprite sheets; and zipped archive bundles. No transcoding or compression is applied."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can it handle infinite-scroll boards or collections?",
      "answer": "Yes. The extension scrolls, paginates, and follows API cursors automatically while keeping your preferred folder structure intact."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does it manage licensing metadata?",
      "answer": "Licensing, attribution, usage notes, and source URLs are stored alongside each asset in JSON/CSV manifests so compliance checks are effortless."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it support bulk campaigns?",
      "answer": "Queue entire provider lists, run them overnight with rate-limit aware throttling, and receive post-download webhooks when each campaign completes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there DAM or cloud storage integration?",
      "answer": "Use built-in hooks to sync completed downloads to S3, Google Cloud Storage, or shared network volumes without leaving the extension."
    },
    {
      "question": "What about private or team-only boards?",
      "answer": "Bring session cookies or headers, store them securely per provider, and if you can view the board you can archive it—no credentials leave your machine."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this legal?",
