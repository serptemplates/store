  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I download a Pornhub video with this extension?",
      "answer": "Open the video, click the downloader icon, choose your preferred resolution, and let the progress bar finish. The MP4 will save using the original title in your downloads folder."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it work with Pornhub Premium?",
      "answer": "Yes. Stay logged into your Premium account and the extension will access subscriber-exclusive streams using your active session—no extra setup required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I download from Thumbzilla too?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. Thumbzilla uses similar players, and the extension detects and downloads those streams using the same workflow."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will it capture captions or interactive overlays?",
      "answer": "The downloader focuses on video and audio. Captions, overlays, or interactive elements aren’t included in the MP4 file."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
      "answer": "Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops. Safari is not supported."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does the tab need to stay open during the download?",
      "answer": "Yes. Keeping the original tab open ensures Premium sessions stay active and progress tracking continues uninterrupted."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my activity private?",
      "answer": "All conversion happens locally and no analytics are collected. Only the final MP4 touches your filesystem so your viewing remains private."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this legal?",
      "answer": "<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> We are not attorneys and do not offer legal advice. Laws vary by country and platform. For any legal question please consult a qualified legal professional.</p>\n<p>We give you full control over download speeds because we believe users should decide how they use their software.</p>\n<p>That said, here are a few widely accepted best practices for safe, responsible downloading:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Only download content you created, own, or have explicit permission from the rights holder to access.</li>\n<li>Protect your personal data by respecting platform rules and rate limits with reasonable download speeds to avoid automated abuse systems putting your account at risk.</li>\n<li>Protect your privacy by using a reputable VPN for IP protection before initiating downloads — <a href=\"https://serp.ly/best/vpn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this is the VPN we recommend &amp; use</a>.</li>\n</ol>"
