description: "Open Video Downloader gives creators, educators, and archivists a reliable\
  \ way to capture Open.video streams for offline viewing or reference. It detects\
  \ players on open.video pages, course portals, and embedded blog posts, then fetches\
  \ every available rendition so you can grab the exact quality you need.\n\nAuthentication\
  \ cookies, signed URLs, and segmented HLS playlists are handled under the hood\u2014\
  no command-line tooling or manual manifest wrangling required. Queue multiple episodes\
  \ or live event replays, keep an eye on segment progress, and let the extension\
  \ merge the stream into a single MP4 while you focus on the rest of your workflow.\n"

faqs:
- question: Will Open Video Downloader work with private Open.video channels?
  answer: If you can play the video in your browser while logged in, the downloader
    can capture it. We forward your existing session cookies instead of bypassing
    permissions you do not have.
- question: Can it download live event replays or long webinars?
  answer: Yes. The extension processes segmented HLS streams, keeps track of the current
    segment, and stitches everything into a single MP4 even for multi-hour recordings.
- question: Do I have to keep the tab open during downloads?
  answer: "Keep the original tab open until the progress bar completes. You can switch\
    \ to other tabs or apps\u2014the downloader continues working in the background."
- question: Does it support batch downloads?
  answer: Queue multiple Open.video URLs inside the extension. Each item gets its
    own progress indicator and can be paused, resumed, or re-ordered.
- question: Are captions or subtitles included?
  answer: The first release focuses on video and audio capture. Subtitle export is
    on the roadmap and will arrive in a future update.
