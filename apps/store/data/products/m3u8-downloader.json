Paste a manifest URL or let the extension auto-detect streams on the page, pick the quality you want, and it will download every segment, forward the right headers, and merge the video in the background without command-line tools.\n\nIt supports master playlists, CMAF/fMP4 segments, and multi-bitrate variants, retries failed chunks automatically, and runs in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, or Opera while keeping your browser responsive. The result is a source-quality MP4 you can archive, edit, or review offline.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I download an m3u8 stream with this extension?",
      "answer": "Paste the playlist URL into the popup or enable auto-detect on the page, select the quality variant you want, and start the conversion. The MP4 will save when segment merging completes."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it work with authenticated streams?",
      "answer": "Yes. The downloader forwards cookies, referrers, and custom headers from your browser session so authorised streams play without manual configuration."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I queue multiple playlists?",
      "answer": "You can add several manifests to the queue and the extension will process them sequentially, keeping your browser responsive while conversions run."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
      "answer": "Builds ship for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Safari is not supported."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will it download DRM-protected or encrypted streams?",
      "answer": "No. The tool works with unencrypted HLS playlists only. DRM-protected streams remain inaccessible."
    },
    {
      "question": "Do subtitles or alternate audio tracks download?",
      "answer": "The downloader captures the selected video/audio rendition. Subtitles or alternate audio tracks are not extracted; download them separately if required."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my data private?",
      "answer": "All detection, downloading, and merging happen locally. Only licence verification touches external servers, and no analytics are collected."
