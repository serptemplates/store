faqs:
  - question: Can I download Khan Academy videos for offline studying?
    answer: Yes! Download video lessons, exercise explanations, and course materials
      for offline learning. Perfect for students with limited internet access or
      those who want to study while traveling.
  - question: Does it download practice exercises and problem sets?
    answer: While the focus is on video content, the downloader saves all accessible
      learning materials including transcripts and supplementary PDFs. Practice
      exercises are best used through Khan Academy's interactive platform.
  - question: Can I download entire course sequences or subject playlists?
    answer: Absolutely! Download complete courses, subject playlists, or learning
      paths with all videos organized by topic and difficulty. This is perfect
      for structured offline learning or classroom use.
  - question: Is this useful for teachers and homeschool parents?
    answer: Very much so! Teachers and parents download Khan Academy content to use
      in classrooms without reliable internet, create custom learning materials,
      or ensure continuity when internet is unavailable. Having offline access
      eliminates connectivity concerns.
  - question: Does it preserve video subtitles in multiple languages?
    answer: Yes! All available subtitle languages are downloaded automatically. This
      is especially valuable for ESL students, language learners, and
      international users who benefit from translations.
