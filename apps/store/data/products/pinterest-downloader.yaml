faqs:
  - question: How does this downloader work?
    answer: Simply install the application, log in to your account (if needed), and
      browse to the content you want to download. The downloader integrates
      seamlessly and provides download buttons directly on the platform, or you
      can paste URLs to queue downloads.
  - question: What makes this downloader reliable?
    answer: We provide regular updates to ensure compatibility whenever the platform
      changes. Our downloader is built specifically for this platform with
      features like batch downloading, quality selection, and automatic
      organization that generic tools lack.
  - question: Can I download multiple items at once?
    answer: Yes! Our batch download feature lets you queue multiple videos, images,
      or files and download them automatically. Just add items to the queue,
      choose your quality settings, and let the downloader work while you focus
      on other tasks.
  - question: What quality options are available?
    answer: You can download in any quality available from the platform, from
      standard definition up to 4K/8K or original quality depending on the
      source. The downloader lets you choose quality per item or set a default
      preference.
  - question: Is my downloaded content organized automatically?
    answer: Yes! Files are automatically organized by creator, date, or category
      based on your preferences. You can also customize folder structures and
      file naming patterns to match your workflow.
  - question: What if the platform updates and breaks the downloader?
    answer: We monitor the platform for changes and release updates quickly to
      maintain compatibility. With your lifetime license, you'll receive all
      updates free forever, ensuring your downloader keeps working reliably.
  - question: Can I use this on multiple computers?
    answer: Yes! Your license typically covers personal use across your devices.
      Install the downloader on your desktop, laptop, or multiple computers as
      long as it's for your personal use.
  - question: How does this protect my privacy?
    answer: All downloads happen directly on your device with no third-party servers
      involved. We don't collect, store, or transmit your data, login
      credentials, or download history. Your privacy is completely protected.
