faqs:
  - question: Can I download Coursera courses I'm enrolled in?
    answer: Yes! Download all video lectures, reading materials, and transcripts
      from courses you're enrolled in. Perfect for learning offline or keeping
      course content after your subscription ends.
  - question: Does it save course subtitles and transcripts?
    answer: Absolutely! All available subtitles and transcripts are downloaded
      automatically in multiple languages. This is especially useful for
      language learners and students who prefer reading along with videos.
  - question: Can I preserve Coursera Specializations and Professional Certificates?
    answer: Yes! Download entire Specializations or Professional Certificate
      programs with all courses, modules, and materials organized exactly as
      they appear on Coursera. Keep your education investment safe permanently.
  - question: What happens if Coursera removes a course I've taken?
    answer: With our downloader, you own a permanent copy. Even if Coursera retires
      courses, changes content, or your access expires, you'll always have your
      downloaded materials. Many students wish they'd backed up courses that are
      no longer available.
  - question: Does it work with Coursera's mobile app or just the website?
    answer: Our downloader works with content from the Coursera website. It's
      actually more powerful than the mobile app because it downloads everything
      in original quality with all resources, whereas the app has limitations
      and requires constant connectivity.
