      "answer": "SERP Video Tools is a cross-browser extension designed to improve how you work with online videos. It lets you download videos, adjust playback speed, scrub precisely, skip ads, grab transcripts and thumbnails, clip specific segments, and convert formats for faster research and reuse."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which websites and video players does it work on?",
      "answer": "It works on most common video players and platforms you encounter online, including embedded videos on blogs, landing pages, course portals, and search results. If a video plays in your browser, there’s a good chance SERP Video Tools can interact with it."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I download videos directly from a page?",
      "answer": "Yes. When a supported video is detected, a download option appears. You can select from available qualities or formats and save the video directly to your computer."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a free trial or free version?",
      "answer": "Currently, there is no fully free version or free trial. We may introduce a free trial in the future, but there is no official timeline yet."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a limit to how much I can download?",
      "answer": "No. There are no download limits. SERP Video Tools allows unlimited downloads, so you can download as much content as you need."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will the video or course owner know that I downloaded their content?",
      "answer": "In most cases, no. Platforms typically do not give content owners access to download-level user data. If you want additional privacy, you can use the SERP VPN extension alongside the downloader."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I use SERP Video Tools on my phone or iPad?",
      "answer": "No. SERP Video Tools is a browser extension and must be used on a desktop or laptop computer. Mobile browsers on phones and tablets do not support the required extension features."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does playback speed control work?",
      "answer": "You can speed videos up to skim content faster or slow them down for detailed review. Speed changes apply instantly and work together with precise scrubbing controls."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I jump forward or backward by specific time intervals?",
      "answer": "Yes. The extension adds quick-jump controls so you can move forward or backward by set time increments without dragging the timeline."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does SERP Video Tools skip ads?",
      "answer": "Ad skipping works on compatible players where ads are part of the video stream. Results depend on how the platform serves ads, so some ads may still appear."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I download transcripts or captions?",
      "answer": "If captions or transcripts are available for a video, SERP Video Tools can extract and download them for offline reading, quoting, or analysis."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I download video thumbnails?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can save available thumbnails directly from the video player, which is useful for previews, documentation, or content planning."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I clip just part of a video instead of the whole thing?",
      "answer": "Yes. You can set start and end points and download only the segment you need, which saves time and storage."
    },
    {
      "question": "What browsers and operating systems are supported?",
      "answer": "SERP Video Tools works on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktop systems."
