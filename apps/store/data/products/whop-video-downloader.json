      "question": "How do I download a Whop video with this extension?",
      "answer": "Log into Whop, open the page with the video, click the on-player download button or the extension popup, choose your quality, and let the progress bar finish. The MP4 will save automatically."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it work with member-only content?",
