  Alpha Porno Video Downloader zeroes in on alphaporno.com video players so you can save clips for offline viewing in a couple clicks. It scans each page for hidden MP4 and HLS manifests, surfaces every quality option, and lets you decide exactly what lands in your downloads folder.

  Concurrent downloads mean you can queue multiple clips at once, watch progress bars inline, and keep browsing while the extension finishes its work. A right-click shortcut and compact popup deliver quality selection, speed indicators, and discreet desktop notifications when each file wraps.

  Licence activation takes seconds and settings stay local, so nothing leaves your browser beyond a quick licence check. The extension only runs on AlphaPorno domains, keeping the rest of your browsing untouched and your saved copies private.

  Keep the source tab open until the merge completes, remember it cannot grab DRM-protected streams, and consider splitting long sessions into batches so your hardware can stitch complex HLS videos without slowing down.

faqs:
- question: How do I start a download with Alpha Porno Video Downloader?
  answer: Install the extension, activate it with your licence key, open any alphaporno.com
    video, and click either the inline download button or the toolbar icon to pick
    a quality. Keep the tab open while the progress bar completes and the MP4 will
    land in your downloads folder.
- question: Can it grab more than one video at the same time?
  answer: Yes. You can launch several downloads in parallel. They continue in the
    background so you can minimise the tab, and you will receive a notification when
    each file is ready.
- question: Does the downloader work on other adult sites?
  answer: No. It is intentionally scoped to alphaporno.com and its video servers.
    Site-specific tuning keeps detection accurate and limits the permissions required.
- question: Why does it request scripting, offscreen, and context menu permissions?
  answer: Scripting reads the video player to collect quality options, offscreen allows
    the HLS merger to run without freezing your tab, and context menu access powers
    the right-click download shortcut. Each permission directly supports a core feature.
- question: Is there a free version or refund policy?
  answer: The tool requires a one-time $17 purchase with no free trial and no refunds.
    Updates for future site changes are included for licence holders.
- question: Which browsers are supported?
  answer: The extension runs on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Brave,
    and Opera across Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops.
