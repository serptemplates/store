  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I download a SproutVideo recording with this extension?",
      "answer": "Open the page containing the SproutVideo player, click the downloader icon, pick your desired resolution, and keep the tab open while the segment counter completes. The MP4 will save automatically."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it work with embedded players on course or membership sites?",
      "answer": "Yes. The extension detects embedded SproutVideo players anywhere on the web and handles them exactly like the main site."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will it download private or password-protected videos?",
      "answer": "If you can watch the video while logged into SproutVideo or the host site, the downloader uses that session to access and save the stream. It does not bypass access you do not already have."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
      "answer": "Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are captions or transcripts included?",
      "answer": "The downloader focuses on video and audio. Captions, transcripts, or attachments should be saved separately from within SproutVideo."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I refresh the page mid-download?",
      "answer": "Progress persists. As long as the original tab remains open, the downloader resumes from the last segment and finishes the MP4."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my data private?",
      "answer": "All detection and conversion happen locally on your computer. Only licence verification touches remote servers, and no viewing history is collected."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this legal?",
      "answer": "<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> We are not attorneys and do not offer legal advice. Laws vary by country and platform. For any legal question please consult a qualified legal professional.</p>\n<p>We give you full control over download speeds because we believe users should decide how they use their software.</p>\n<p>That said, here are a few widely accepted best practices for safe, responsible downloading:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Only download content you created, own, or have explicit permission from the rights holder to access.</li>\n<li>Protect your personal data by respecting platform rules and rate limits with reasonable download speeds to avoid automated abuse systems putting your account at risk.</li>\n<li>Protect your privacy by using a reputable VPN for IP protection before initiating downloads — <a href=\"https://serp.ly/best/vpn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this is the VPN we recommend &amp; use</a>.</li>\n</ol>"
