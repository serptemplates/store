  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I download a SproutVideo recording with this extension?",
      "answer": "Open the page containing the SproutVideo player, click the downloader icon, pick your desired resolution, and keep the tab open while the segment counter completes. The MP4 will save automatically."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it work with embedded players on course or membership sites?",
      "answer": "Yes. The extension detects embedded SproutVideo players anywhere on the web and handles them exactly like the main site."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will it download private or password-protected videos?",
      "answer": "If you can watch the video while logged into SproutVideo or the host site, the downloader uses that session to access and save the stream. It does not bypass access you do not already have."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
      "answer": "Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops."
    },
    {
      "question": "Are captions or transcripts included?",
      "answer": "The downloader focuses on video and audio. Captions, transcripts, or attachments should be saved separately from within SproutVideo."
    },
    {
      "question": "What happens if I refresh the page mid-download?",
      "answer": "Progress persists. As long as the original tab remains open, the downloader resumes from the last segment and finishes the MP4."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my data private?",
      "answer": "All detection and conversion happen locally on your computer. Only licence verification touches remote servers, and no viewing history is collected."
