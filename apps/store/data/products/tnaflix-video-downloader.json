  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I download a TNAFlix video with this extension?",
      "answer": "Open the video, click the downloader icon, choose your desired resolution, and keep the tab open while the progress bar completes. The MP4 will save automatically."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it work on all TNAFlix sections and mirrors?",
      "answer": "Yes. The extension recognises both tnaflix.com and www.tnaflix.com variations and handles categories across the site."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I download several videos at once?",
      "answer": "Downloads run one at a time to keep progress accurate. Queue the next video after the current download finishes."

    {
      "question": "Is my activity private?",
      "answer": "All detection and downloading happen locally. The extension only checks your licence and never uploads viewing history."
