  Skool Video Downloader makes course lessons, community uploads, and classroom recordings available offline before access changes. It uses your active Skool login to detect videos, lists every resolution the platform provides, and converts the stream into a smooth MP4 without leaving the browser.

  Queue a lesson, let the downloader fetch each segment with your authentication headers, and it will merge everything in the background while you continue studying. The result is a private MP4 library that mirrors what you can watch inside Skool.

  benefits:

  - Study offline during travel or low-connectivity periods without buffering
  - Keep downloads private with all processing handled on your own device
faqs:
- question: How do I download a Skool lesson with this extension?
  answer: Open the lesson, click the downloader icon, choose your quality, and keep
    the tab open while the segment counter completes. The MP4 will save with the community
    and lesson name.
- question: Does it work with private communities or paid cohorts?
  answer: Yes. The downloader uses your existing Skool session, so any video you can
    watch while logged in can be saved offline.
- question: Can I download multiple lessons at once?
  answer: Downloads run one at a time to keep session tokens valid. Queue the next
    lesson after the current progress bar finishes.
- question: Which browsers are supported?
  answer: Versions are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows,
    macOS, and Linux desktops. Safari is not supported.
- question: Do captions or attachments download too?
  answer: Videos export as MP4 files. Captions, PDFs, or other attachments should
    be saved separately from within Skool.
- question: What happens if I refresh the page?
  answer: Progress persists. As long as the original tab remains open, the downloader
    resumes from the last segment and finishes the MP4.
- question: Is my data private?
  answer: All detection and conversion happen locally. Only licence checks touch remote
    servers, and no viewing history or passwords are stored.

  review: I grabbed every classroom replay before the cohort closed. Segment counters
    let me know how long each download would take.

    my login automatically and the MP4 quality is flawless.

permission_justifications:
- permission: downloads
  justification: |
    Saves the finished MP4 to your downloads folder and keeps the progress tracker
    accurate for each lesson.
- permission: storage
  justification: |

    the downloader stays ready between sessions.
- permission: activeTab
  justification: |
    Detects Skool lesson players and community videos on the tab you are viewing
    and injects the download controls there.
- permission: tabs
  justification: |
    Allows downloads to continue if you refresh or switch lessons and restores the
    status window when you return.
- permission: scripting
  justification: |
    Extracts stream manifests, quality variants, and authentication headers from
    the page so the downloader can fetch the correct segments.
- permission: notifications
  justification: |
    Sends completion or error alerts so you know when a recording finishes downloading
    without monitoring the UI.
- permission: contextMenus
  justification: |
    Adds a “Download with Skool Video Downloader” entry to the right-click menu for
    quick access inside lessons.

    Merges HLS segments into MP4 files in the background, keeping your lesson tab
    responsive during conversion.
- permission: host_permissions

    Grants limited access to skool.com and related video hosts so the extension only
    activates on pages that serve Skool content.
