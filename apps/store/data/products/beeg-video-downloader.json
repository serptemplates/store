  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I download a Beeg video with this extension?",
      "answer": "Activate your licence, open a Beeg video, let the player finish loading, then click the inline download button or toolbar icon. Choose the resolution you want and keep the tab open while the progress panel shows segment and merge status."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can it download multiple videos at once?",
      "answer": "Yes. Start another download from a different tab or window and each job runs in parallel. You will get a notification when every MP4 is ready."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it support subtitles or playlists?",
      "answer": "The extension focuses on video streams. If captions are embedded in the video they will be preserved, but it does not fetch separate subtitle files or auto-queue entire playlists."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the downloader need scripting and offscreen permissions?",
      "answer": "Scripting inspects the video player to list quality options, while the offscreen context converts HLS segments to MP4 without tying up the tab you are browsing in."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a free version or refund policy?",
      "answer": "There is no free tier. A one-time $9 licence unlocks the extension and includes future Beeg compatibility updates, but sales are final."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
      "answer": "Beeg Video Downloader ships for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this legal?",
