  "description": "Beeg Video Downloader automates the HLS-to-MP4 conversion that keeps most Beeg videos locked to streaming. It detects the player as soon as it loads, captures the hidden playlists, and gives you a clean list of quality options so you can archive clips in the resolution you prefer.\n\nA guided popup displays bitrate, estimated file size, and stream type before you download. Once you start, an inline progress manager tracks segment speed, percentage, and ETA while background workers stitch the MP4 together with retries whenever a chunk fails.\n\nThe extension keeps everything local—licence details, quality presets, and downloaded files never leave your browser. Desktop notifications and a right-click shortcut make saving multiple videos at once as simple as queuing them and returning when the alerts fire.\n\nActivation requires a one-time licence and it is worth letting each tab stay open until processing completes. HLS conversion takes a little CPU time, but you get lossless MP4 copies without juggling developer tools or command-line scripts.",

    "Quality picker showing resolution, bitrate, and estimated file size",
    "Concurrent download support so multiple videos finish in parallel",
    "Inline progress panel with percentage, speed, and ETA readouts",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I download a Beeg video with this extension?",
      "answer": "Activate your licence, open a Beeg video, let the player finish loading, then click the inline download button or toolbar icon. Choose the resolution you want and keep the tab open while the progress panel shows segment and merge status."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can it download multiple videos at once?",
      "answer": "Yes. Start another download from a different tab or window and each job runs in parallel. You will get a notification when every MP4 is ready."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it support subtitles or playlists?",
      "answer": "The extension focuses on video streams. If captions are embedded in the video they will be preserved, but it does not fetch separate subtitle files or auto-queue entire playlists."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does the downloader need scripting and offscreen permissions?",
      "answer": "Scripting inspects the video player to list quality options, while the offscreen context converts HLS segments to MP4 without tying up the tab you are browsing in."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is there a free version or refund policy?",
      "answer": "There is no free tier. A one-time $9 licence unlocks the extension and includes future Beeg compatibility updates, but sales are final."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
      "answer": "Beeg Video Downloader ships for Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops."
    },
    {
