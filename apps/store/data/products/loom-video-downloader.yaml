  Loom Video Downloader helps remote teams and creators save recordings before links expire. It detects Loom share pages, embedded players, and workspace libraries, prompts for passwords when required, and converts every recording into a standard MP4 you can archive, edit, or watch offline.

  Whether Loom delivers the video as a direct MP4 or an adaptive HLS/DASH stream, the downloader queues the job, fetches segments in the background, merges them without freezing your browser, and keeps you informed with live progress, speed, and ETA. Queue multiple recordings, cancel any job midstream, and keep your content accessible even after access changes.

  Everything runs locally in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, or Opera using your existing Loom account, so private recordings stay private while you build the library your team relies on.

faqs:
  - question: How do I download a Loom recording with this extension?
    answer: Open the Loom share page or embedded player, click the downloader icon,
      enter a password if prompted, choose your preferred quality, and let the
      queue finish. The MP4 saves with the original recording name.
  - question: Does it support password-protected Loom links?
    answer: Yes. The extension prompts for the share password, uses it for that
      session only, and never stores the credential.
  - question: Can I queue multiple Loom recordings?
    answer: You can add several recordings to the queue and the downloader will
      process them sequentially, keeping you within Loom’s rate limits.
  - question: Which browsers work with Loom Video Downloader?
    answer: Versions are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on
      Windows, macOS, and Linux. Safari is not supported.
  - question: Do captions or transcripts download with the video?
    answer: Loom’s automated captions aren’t exported. The tool focuses on
      delivering a clean MP4; download transcripts separately from Loom if
      required.
  - question: Why does it need offscreen access?
    answer: Loom often streams recordings via HLS or DASH. Offscreen processing lets
      the extension merge those segments into an MP4 without freezing your
      browser.
  - question: Is my data private?
    answer: All detection and conversion happen locally. Only licence checks touch
      remote servers, and the extension never stores your passwords or viewing
      history.

    title: Passworded recordings finally easy
    rating: 5
    date: 2025-02-20
    review: Clients lock every Loom share with a password. This prompts once,
      downloads the MP4, and I never have to chase them for access again.

    review: Our documentation embeds Loom everywhere. The queue converts each HLS
      stream flawlessly and names files so I can edit them immediately.

    review: We archive standups and training in batches. Notifications let me run
      downloads in the background without babysitting.

permission_justifications:
  - permission: downloads
    justification: |
      Streams the finished MP4 into your downloads folder and keeps queue progress
      accurate for each Loom recording.
  - permission: storage
    justification: |
      Saves licence activation, queue preferences, and last-used quality locally so
      the extension stays ready between sessions.
  - permission: activeTab
    justification: |
      Detects when a Loom share page or embedded player is open and injects the download
      controls into that exact tab.
  - permission: tabs
    justification: |
      Allows queued downloads to continue if you switch tabs and restores the status
      window when you return.
  - permission: scripting
    justification: |
      Reads Loom player data, extracts stream manifests, and coordinates password prompts
      so recordings can be queued accurately.
  - permission: notifications
    justification: |
      Sends completion and error alerts so you know when recordings finish without
      watching the progress window.
  - permission: contextMenus
    justification: |
      Adds a “Download with Loom Video Downloader” option to the right-click menu for
      quick queueing from any share link.
  - permission: offscreen
    justification: |
      Merges HLS and DASH segments into MP4 files in the background, preventing the
      active tab from freezing during large downloads.
  - permission: cookies
    justification: |
      Uses existing Loom session cookies to access private or team-only recordings
      without asking for your password again.
  - permission: host_permissions
    justification: |
      Limits privileged access to loom.com, share URLs, and Loom CDNs so the extension
      only activates where recordings actually live.
