faqs:
- question: How do I download images from Canva?
  answer: Simply copy the image URL or post link from Canva, paste it into the downloader, and click download. The image will be saved to your computer in its original quality within seconds.
- question: Can I download images in bulk?
  answer: Yes! The batch download feature allows you to download multiple images, entire galleries, or even whole user profiles at once. This is perfect for creating collections or backups of Canva content.
- question: Does this preserve the original image quality?
  answer: Absolutely! The downloader fetches the highest resolution version available from Canva. Images are saved without any compression or quality degradation, giving you pristine originals.
- question: What image formats are supported?
  answer: The downloader supports all common formats including JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, and more. You can also convert images to different formats during download if needed.
- question: Can I download without watermarks?
  answer: If Canva content includes watermarks, the downloader saves images as they appear. For watermark-free downloads, ensure you have proper licenses or download your own content.
- question: Does this work with private or restricted content?
  answer: You can download content you have permission to view. If you're logged in and can access certain images, the downloader will work. However, content you cannot normally view cannot be downloaded.
- question: How are downloaded images organized?
  answer: Images can be automatically organized by date, source, or custom folders. The downloader preserves metadata like titles, descriptions, and tags, making it easy to search and manage your collection.
