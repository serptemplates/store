  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I download an Erome video with this extension?",
      "answer": "Open the post, let the player finish loading, click the Erome Downloader icon, pick your preferred quality, and keep the tab open while the progress bar completes. The MP4 will save to your default downloads folder."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it label every quality correctly?",
      "answer": "Yes. The extension analyses filenames and metadata to identify each available resolution, orders them from highest to lowest, and marks whether the source is MP4 or HLS so you can choose confidently."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I cancel or pause a download?",
      "answer": "You can cancel at any time using the button in the progress panel. Pausing isn’t supported, but you can restart the download from the beginning whenever you’re ready."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it support albums or multi-video bundles?",
      "answer": "The downloader focuses on single videos. If a post contains multiple clips, launch each download individually—there’s no ZIP or album packaging."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
      "answer": "Erome Downloader ships builds for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It does not support Safari or mobile browsers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does it need scripting and offscreen permissions?",
      "answer": "Scripting inspects the page to locate hidden video URLs, and the offscreen context stitches HLS segments into a single MP4 without freezing your tab. Both are required for reliable downloads."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my data private?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. All extraction, assembly, and storage happen locally. Only licence verification touches external servers, and no download history is collected."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this legal?",
      "answer": "<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> We are not attorneys and do not offer legal advice. Laws vary by country and platform. For any legal question please consult a qualified legal professional.</p>\n<p>We give you full control over download speeds because we believe users should decide how they use their software.</p>\n<p>That said, here are a few widely accepted best practices for safe, responsible downloading:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Only download content you created, own, or have explicit permission from the rights holder to access.</li>\n<li>Protect your personal data by respecting platform rules and rate limits with reasonable download speeds to avoid automated abuse systems putting your account at risk.</li>\n<li>Protect your privacy by using a reputable VPN for IP protection before initiating downloads — <a href=\"https://serp.ly/best/vpn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this is the VPN we recommend &amp; use</a>.</li>\n</ol>"
