  "description": "Erome Downloader is built specifically for Erome’s player so you can save clips before creators remove them. The extension scans each post with multiple detection methods—HTML5 tags, metadata, and script analysis—to surface every MP4 or HLS source and label it clearly with resolution, format, and estimated size.\n\nChoose the rendition you want, click download, and a persistent progress panel tracks percentage, speed, and time remaining while background workers assemble HLS segments into a single MP4. A cancel button lets you stop mid-stream without leaving half-finished files, and desktop notifications confirm the moment the video is ready.\n\nAll processing stays local: licence data, preferences, and downloads never leave your browser, and permissions are scoped to Erome domains only. Right-click shortcuts and inline controls make it simple to archive the videos you care about before they disappear.\n\nRun it in Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, or Linux—just keep the tab open until the download finishes for the cleanest files.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I download an Erome video with this extension?",
      "answer": "Open the post, let the player finish loading, click the Erome Downloader icon, pick your preferred quality, and keep the tab open while the progress bar completes. The MP4 will save to your default downloads folder."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it label every quality correctly?",
      "answer": "Yes. The extension analyses filenames and metadata to identify each available resolution, orders them from highest to lowest, and marks whether the source is MP4 or HLS so you can choose confidently."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I cancel or pause a download?",
      "answer": "You can cancel at any time using the button in the progress panel. Pausing isn’t supported, but you can restart the download from the beginning whenever you’re ready."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it support albums or multi-video bundles?",
      "answer": "The downloader focuses on single videos. If a post contains multiple clips, launch each download individually—there’s no ZIP or album packaging."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
      "answer": "Erome Downloader ships builds for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It does not support Safari or mobile browsers."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does it need scripting and offscreen permissions?",
      "answer": "Scripting inspects the page to locate hidden video URLs, and the offscreen context stitches HLS segments into a single MP4 without freezing your tab. Both are required for reliable downloads."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my data private?",
      "answer": "Absolutely. All extraction, assembly, and storage happen locally. Only licence verification touches external servers, and no download history is collected."
