faqs:
- question: Can I download YouTube videos in 4K or 8K quality?
  answer: Yes, this downloader supports ultra-high-definition downloads including 4K and 8K videos when available. The actual resolution depends on what the original uploader provided. You can select your preferred quality during download.
