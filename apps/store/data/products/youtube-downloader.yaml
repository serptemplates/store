  benefits:
  - Archive Shorts, embedded players, and unlisted review links without quality loss
  - Deliver ready-to-edit MP4 files by merging adaptive streams automatically
  - Keep projects private thanks to on-device decryption and background processing
faqs:
- question: Does it work with YouTube Shorts and embedded players?
  answer: Yes. The extension detects Shorts feeds, standard watch pages, and embedded
    players on third-party sites, then serves the same quality list in each case.
- question: Can I download a livestream while it is broadcasting?
  answer: The downloader supports livestream replays, but it needs the on-demand version
    to exist first. Once the replay is posted it converts the HLS stream into a single
    MP4.
- question: Will it download movies or episodes I purchased on YouTube?
  answer: No. DRM-protected purchases remain off limits. The downloader only works
    on videos you can already view without digital rights management.
- question: How many downloads can run simultaneously?
  answer: Up to three downloads can be active at once. Each item shows progress, speed,
    and an interrupt button so you can prioritise what matters.
- question: Do I need to keep the video tab open the whole time?
  answer: For long conversions we recommend keeping the original tab open. That ensures
    the stream segments stay available until the MP4 is finalised.
- question: Which browsers are supported?
  answer: "Chrome and Chromium-based browsers like Edge, Brave, and Opera are supported.\
    \ Make sure you\u2019re on an up-to-date build for Manifest V3 compatibility."

  review: The quality list and file-size estimates mean no surprises, and the three-download
    queue lets me prep assets for edits in one sitting.

  review: Embedded videos on partner portals used to be a pain. This extension detects
    them instantly and finishes the background conversion while we keep browsing.
