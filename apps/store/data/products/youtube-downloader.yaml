faqs:
- question: Can I download YouTube videos in 4K or 8K quality?
  answer: Yes, this downloader supports ultra-high-definition downloads including
    4K and 8K videos when available. The actual resolution depends on what the original
    uploader provided. You can select your preferred quality during download.
- question: Can I extract just the audio from YouTube videos?
  answer: Yes, the downloader includes audio extraction in multiple formats (MP3,
    AAC, FLAC, etc.). This is perfect for downloading music, podcasts, or any content
    where you only need the audio track.
- question: Will this downloader work with age-restricted or private videos?
  answer: The downloader can handle age-restricted videos if you authenticate with
    your YouTube account. However, truly private videos require proper access permissions
    from the video owner. We respect content privacy and platform terms.
- question: How fast are the downloads compared to my internet speed?
  answer: Download speeds are optimized to use your full bandwidth. For most users,
    downloads complete at near-maximum internet speeds. Factors like server load and
    video encoding can affect speeds.
- question: Is there a download limit?
  answer: No, there are no artificial download limits. You can download as many videos
    as your storage allows, one at a time.
- question: What happens if my download gets interrupted?
  answer: The downloader includes a robust resume feature. If your internet disconnects
    or the app closes, you can resume downloads exactly where they left off without
    starting over, saving time and bandwidth.
- question: Does this work on all browsers?
  answer: The extension works on major desktop browsers including Chrome, Firefox,
    and Edge. Make sure your browser is up to date for the best compatibility.
