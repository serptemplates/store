faqs:
  - question: Does this downloader work with YouTube playlists and channels?
    answer: Yes, our YouTube downloader supports batch downloading from playlists
      and entire channels. You can save multiple videos at once, maintaining the
      original playlist structure and video quality up to 8K resolution.
  - question: Can I download YouTube videos with subtitles and captions?
    answer: Absolutely! The downloader automatically extracts available subtitles
      and closed captions in all available languages. Subtitles are saved as
      separate SRT files that work with any media player.
  - question: What makes this different from free YouTube downloaders?
    answer: Unlike free tools that often break after YouTube updates, our downloader
      offers reliable lifetime updates, faster download speeds, batch
      processing, automatic subtitle extraction, and format conversion without
      quality loss. No ads, no limitations.
  - question: Can I download live streams and premieres from YouTube?
    answer: Yes, you can record live streams in real-time or download them after
      they finish. The tool also works with scheduled premieres once they go
      live, capturing them in the highest available quality.
  - question: How does the duplicate detection feature work?
    answer: Our smart duplicate detection scans your library and prevents
      re-downloading videos you already have. This saves time and storage space
      when downloading from channels or playlists you've previously accessed.
