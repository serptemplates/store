faqs:
- question: How do I install AI Voice Cloner?
  answer: Install Docker Desktop on your computer, download the AI Voice Cloner package
    from the website, extract it to your Desktop, and run 'docker compose up' from
    the terminal. The app will start a local web server at http://localhost:80 that
    you can access in your browser.
- question: Does AI Voice Cloner require an internet connection?
  answer: No, AI Voice Cloner runs completely offline on your local computer. Once
    installed, you don't need an internet connection to use the text-to-speech or
    voice cloning features. All processing happens locally on your machine.
- question: How does voice cloning work?
  answer: Voice cloning allows you to create a synthetic voice model from a short
    audio sample. Upload a few seconds of someone speaking, and the app will learn
    their voice characteristics to generate new speech in that voice from any text
    you provide.
- question: What operating systems are supported?
  answer: AI Voice Cloner works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It uses Docker to ensure
    consistent performance across all platforms. Both CPU and NVIDIA GPU acceleration
    are supported for faster processing.
- question: Is my data private and secure?
  answer: Yes, absolutely. All voice models, audio samples, and generated speech are
    stored locally on your computer. Nothing is sent to the cloud or external servers.
    You have complete control over your data and privacy.
- question: Do I need a powerful computer to run this?
  answer: AI Voice Cloner can run on most modern computers using CPU processing. For
    faster performance, NVIDIA GPU acceleration is supported. The first-time setup
    takes a few minutes to download models, but subsequent runs are quick.
- question: Can I use the generated voices commercially?
  answer: Usage rights depend on the voice models you use and the audio samples you
    clone. Always ensure you have permission to clone someone's voice. For commercial
    use, verify the licensing terms of any pre-trained models you're using.
- question: How natural do the voices sound?
  answer: AI Voice Cloner produces high-quality, natural-sounding speech using advanced
    text-to-speech models. The quality depends on the input text and voice sample
    used for cloning, but most users find the results very realistic and usable for
    various projects.
