faqs:
- question: How do I install AI Voice Cloner?
  answer: Install Docker Desktop on your computer, download the AI Voice Cloner package from the website, extract it to your Desktop, and run 'docker compose up' from the terminal. The app will start a local web server at http://localhost:80 that you can access in your browser.
- question: Does AI Voice Cloner require an internet connection?
  answer: No, AI Voice Cloner runs completely offline on your local computer. Once installed, you don't need an internet connection to use the text-to-speech or voice cloning features. All processing happens locally on your machine.
- question: How does voice cloning work?
  answer: Voice cloning allows you to create a synthetic voice model from a short audio sample. Upload a few seconds of someone speaking, and the app will learn their voice characteristics to generate new speech in that voice from any text you provide.
- question: What operating systems are supported?
  answer: AI Voice Cloner works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It uses Docker to ensure consistent performance across all platforms. Both CPU and NVIDIA GPU acceleration are supported for faster processing.
- question: Is my data private and secure?
  answer: Yes, absolutely. All voice models, audio samples, and generated speech are stored locally on your computer. Nothing is sent to the cloud or external servers. You have complete control over your data and privacy.
- question: Do I need a powerful computer to run this?
  answer: AI Voice Cloner can run on most modern computers using CPU processing. For faster performance, NVIDIA GPU acceleration is supported. The first-time setup takes a few minutes to download models, but subsequent runs are quick.
- question: Can I use the generated voices commercially?
  answer: Usage rights depend on the voice models you use and the audio samples you clone. Always ensure you have permission to clone someone's voice. For commercial use, verify the licensing terms of any pre-trained models you're using.
- question: How natural do the voices sound?
  answer: AI Voice Cloner produces high-quality, natural-sounding speech using advanced text-to-speech models. The quality depends on the input text and voice sample used for cloning, but most users find the results very realistic and usable for various projects.
