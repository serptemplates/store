description: 'Circle Downloader keeps community lessons and cohort recordings alive
  long after the posts disappear. It recognises both native Circle uploads and embedded
  players from YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, and Loom, then lets you save them as clean
  MP4 files without juggling separate tools.


  The extension lists every quality rendition, labels the stream type, and remembers
  your preferred resolution for the next download. You can run up to three downloads
  at the same time, keep the global progress manager pinned while you browse, and
  queue additional videos that start automatically when a slot opens up.


  Everything happens with your existing Circle login inside the browser. Adaptive
  streams download chunk by chunk with retries and merge in the background, while
  direct MP4 uploads land instantly in the folder you choose. Notifications confirm
  when files are ready so you can archive resources, flight-proof course material,
  or revisit cohort calls offline.

faqs:
- question: Which video platforms does Circle Downloader support?
  answer: It captures Circle native uploads and embedded players from YouTube, Vimeo,
    Wistia, and Loom. Everything it detects appears in the popup with labels so you
    always know which source you are saving.
- question: Can I download several lessons at the same time?
  answer: Yes. Up to three downloads run concurrently. Additional videos wait in a
    queue and start automatically when a slot opens, so you can line up a batch of
    lessons and let the downloader work through them.
- question: Does it keep the original quality of adaptive streams?
  answer: Absolutely. You can pick any rendition the community provides. HLS and DASH
    sources download segment by segment and merge into an MP4 without re-encoding,
    preserving the original bitrate.
- question: Will it download member-only or private community content?
  answer: If you can view the post in Circle, the extension can download it. It uses
    your existing Circle authentication and never asks for separate credentials.
- question: Is there a free trial or refund option?
  answer: The extension requires a paid licence with no free tier and all sales are
    final. Updates for new Circle player changes are included.
- question: Which browsers and operating systems are supported?
  answer: It runs on Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera across Windows, macOS,
    and Linux desktops.

  review: I download every coaching call before the community archives it. Mixed embeds
    and native uploads all save to one folder and the queue keeps three running at
    a time.

  review: We rely on Circle for client onboarding videos. This extension grabs the
    Loom and Vimeo embeds in one sweep with quality labels so nothing gets missed.

  review: My membership includes member-only lessons and the downloader uses my login
    automatically. Downloads finish quietly while I prepare for flights.
