  benefits:
  - Archive password-protected and private Vimeo links for offline editing
  - Save embeds from portfolio or client review sites without copy/paste workflows
  - Keep downloads private with on-device processing and no analytics
faqs:
- question: How do I download a password-protected Vimeo video?
  answer: Open the video, click the downloader icon, enter the same password you use
    in the Vimeo player, choose your quality, and let the download finish. The MP4
    will save automatically.
- question: Can I download private or team videos?
  answer: "Yes, as long as you\u2019re logged into Vimeo and have permission to view\
    \ the video. The extension uses your session to access the file and never bypasses\
    \ permissions."
- question: Does it work on embedded Vimeo players?
  answer: Absolutely. Whether the player lives on vimeo.com or is embedded on a client
    portal or portfolio site, the extension detects it and offers the same download
    workflow.
- question: How many videos can I download at once?
  answer: You can run up to three simultaneous downloads. Each shows its own progress
    bar so you can monitor status at a glance.
- question: Will captions or subtitles download too?
  answer: The downloader focuses on video and audio. Subtitles or caption files should
    be saved separately from within Vimeo if you need them.
- question: Which browsers are supported?
  answer: Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows,
    macOS, and Linux desktops.
