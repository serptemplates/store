faqs:
  - question: Is it legal to download Vimeo videos?
    answer: It depends on the video's copyright status and your intended use. Always ensure you have permission or the right to download content. Educational fair use may apply in some cases.
  - question: How to Download restricted Vimeo videos?
    answer: >-
      Video creators can disable downloads. Only Vimeo Plus members and higher can enable/disable this feature for their videos. However, the Vimeo Video Downloader allows you to download Vimeo videos from anywhere, even if the "download" button is disabled.
  - question: Can I download private Vimeo videos?
    answer: Only if you have legitimate access (password, permission, or ownership). Our recommended downloader supports private videos when you have proper authorization.
  - question: How do I Download a video that cannot be downloaded?
    answer: Use a professional Vimeo downloader tool that bypasses download restrictions. These tools can extract video files directly from Vimeo's servers, even when the standard download option is unavailable or disabled by the content creator.
  - question: How can I download multiple videos at once?
    answer: Professional Vimeo downloaders offer batch download functionality. You can paste multiple Vimeo URLs at once or use playlist URLs to download entire collections. This saves time compared to downloading videos individually.
  - question: How to Download a video from a website that doesn't have a Download option?
    answer: Vimeo regularly updates their platform, breaking manual methods and extensions. Professional tools are updated to maintain compatibility and can download videos regardless of whether the website provides a download button.
