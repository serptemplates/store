faqs:
  - question: How do I use IndaVideo Downloader?
    answer: Open IndaVideo, choose the videos you need, and start the download
      directly from the app. Files save to your designated folder immediately.
  - question: What quality options are available?
    answer: IndaVideo Downloader keeps the highest quality available from IndaVideo,
      preserving resolution, bitrate, and metadata whenever possible.
  - question: Does this work with private or DRM content?
    answer: It's designed for publicly accessible material that you have rights to
      download. It doesn't bypass DRM, logins, or paywalls.

      or content copies.
