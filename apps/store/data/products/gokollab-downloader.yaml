  GoKollab Downloader is a workspace-aware tool that lets teams save training videos, workshop replays, and shared resources before they disappear. It detects native GoKollab uploads alongside embedded players from YouTube, Vimeo, Wistia, and Loom, lining up every available stream so you can capture it as an MP4.

  Choose the quality tier you need and the extension handles both direct MP4s and adaptive HLS/DASH streams—collecting segments in the background, merging them into a single file, and reporting progress, speed, and estimated time remaining the whole way. Right-click shortcuts keep captures quick while you stay inside your workspace.

  Because it runs within your authenticated GoKollab session, the downloader automatically honours workspace permissions, works across multiple teams, and keeps your captured assets private on your own device.

faqs:
  - question: How do I capture a GoKollab video?
    answer: Open the workspace post or module, click the GoKollab Downloader icon,
      choose your preferred resolution, and keep the tab open while the progress
      bar completes. The MP4 will save using the workspace and item name.
  - question: Does it support multiple workspaces and teams?
    answer: Yes. The extension uses your active GoKollab session and respects
      project and team permissions, so any video you can watch can be captured.
  - question: Can I queue entire workspaces?
    answer: Captures are launched one video at a time. You can line up several
      clips, but there is no full-workspace export or automatic bundling.
  - question: Are captions or transcripts included?
    answer: The downloader focuses on video and audio. Captions, transcripts, and
      attached docs remain in GoKollab, so download those separately if you need
      them.
  - question: Which browsers are supported?
    answer: Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on
      Windows, macOS, and Linux. Safari and mobile browsers aren’t supported.
  - question: Why does it need host permissions for embed providers?
    answer: Workspaces frequently embed third-party players. Host permissions let
      the extension detect those streams so you can download everything you’re
      authorised to view.
  - question: Is my workspace data secure?
    answer: Absolutely. All detection and conversion occurs locally, only licence
      checks touch external servers, and no viewing history or credentials are
      stored.
