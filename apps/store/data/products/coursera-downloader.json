  "description": "Coursera Downloader makes it easy to keep lecture videos available when your internet isn’t. It detects Coursera’s native player inside courses, specializations, and guided projects, then presents every resolution you can access so you can save the lesson as a standard MP4.\n\nDirect MP4s finish quickly, while adaptive HLS and DASH streams are fetched in segments, merged in the background, and delivered with the original quality intact. Real-time progress, speed, and ETA keep you informed during longer lectures, and right-click shortcuts let you start downloads without leaving the lesson view.\n\nThe extension authenticates through your existing Coursera session, respects enrollment status, and processes everything locally—perfect for building offline study libraries before courses retire or subscriptions change.",

  "faqs": [
    {
      "question": "How do I download a Coursera lecture?",
      "answer": "Open the lecture, click the Coursera Downloader icon, pick your preferred resolution, and keep the tab open while the progress bar completes. The MP4 will save with the course and lecture name."
    },
    {
      "question": "Can I download entire courses automatically?",
      "answer": "Downloads are launched one lecture at a time. There’s no batch export, but you can queue multiple lessons manually."
    },
    {
      "question": "Does it include captions or transcripts?",
      "answer": "No. The extension focuses on video and audio. Download captions or transcripts separately from the course materials if you need them."
    },
    {
      "question": "Which browsers are supported?",
      "answer": "Builds are available for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Brave, and Opera on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Safari and mobile browsers aren’t supported."
    },
    {
      "question": "Will it download content I’m not enrolled in?",
      "answer": "No. The downloader works within your active Coursera session and only captures videos you’re legitimately enrolled in or can preview."
    },
    {
      "question": "Why does it request scripting and offscreen permissions?",
      "answer": "Scripting reads the player to enumerate stream URLs, and the offscreen context stitches HLS/DASH segments into a single MP4 without freezing your browser."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is my data private?",
      "answer": "Yes. All detection and conversion happen locally. Only licence verification touches remote servers, and no watch history or credentials are stored."
    },
    {
      "question": "Is this legal?",
      "answer": "<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> We are not attorneys and do not offer legal advice. Laws vary by country and platform.
