  SERP Image Downloader is the all-format asset grabber for creative teams that need the fastest path from inspiration to organised library. It recognises 1,000+ stock sites, marketplaces, design tools, and social feeds, fetches original-resolution files—JPG, PNG, SVG, WebP, AVIF, sprites, and zipped collections—and hands you clean, deduplicated folders tagged with the metadata you care about.

  The extension maintains a living provider manifest, unwraps complex gallery APIs, and stitches infinite-scrolling boards into tidy downloads without brittle manual scripts. Design ops teams can schedule bulk pulls, auto-map licensing metadata, and sync drops straight into DAM buckets while keeping everything on-device.

faqs:
- question: What file formats can SERP Image Downloader capture?
  answer: It pulls whatever the provider serves—raster formats like JPG, PNG, WebP, AVIF; scalable assets like SVG and EPS; sprite sheets; and zipped archive bundles. No transcoding or compression is applied.
- question: Can it handle infinite-scroll boards or collections?
  answer: Yes. The extension scrolls, paginates, and follows API cursors automatically while keeping your preferred folder structure intact.
- question: How does it manage licensing metadata?
  answer: Licensing, attribution, usage notes, and source URLs are stored alongside each asset in JSON/CSV manifests so compliance checks are effortless.
- question: Does it support bulk campaigns?
  answer: Queue entire provider lists, run them overnight with rate-limit aware throttling, and receive post-download webhooks when each campaign completes.
- question: Is there DAM or cloud storage integration?
  answer: Use built-in hooks to sync completed downloads to S3, Google Cloud Storage, or shared network volumes without leaving the extension.
- question: What about private or team-only boards?
  answer: Bring session cookies or headers, store them securely per provider, and if you can view the board you can archive it—no credentials leave your machine.
