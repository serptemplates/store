faqs:
- question: How do I use MediaFire Downloader?
  answer: Open MediaFire, choose the files you need, and start the download directly
    from the app. Files save to your designated folder immediately.
- question: What quality options are available?
  answer: MediaFire Downloader keeps the highest quality available from MediaFire,
    preserving resolution, bitrate, and metadata whenever possible.
- question: Does this work with private or DRM content?
  answer: It's designed for publicly accessible material that you have rights to download.
    It doesn't bypass DRM, logins, or paywalls.
- question: Can I run bulk downloads?
  answer: Yes. Queue multiple links and the downloader processes them sequentially
    with automatic retries if the connection drops.
- question: Is my data tracked?
  answer: No. Downloads stay on your device and we don't capture usage analytics or
    content copies.
