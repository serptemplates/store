faqs:
- question: How do I use Naver Downloader?
  answer: Open Naver, choose the videos you need, and start the download directly
    from the app. Files save to your designated folder immediately.
- question: What quality options are available?
  answer: Naver Downloader keeps the highest quality available from Naver, preserving
    resolution, bitrate, and metadata whenever possible.

  answer: It's designed for publicly accessible material that you have rights to download.

    with automatic retries if the connection drops.

    content copies.
