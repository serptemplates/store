When you ship a new downloader lander, spend an afternoon tightening up the checkout experience. These five ideas show up again and again in the highest converting SERP Apps properties.

1. **Lead with the outcome.** Your CTA headline should promise the win, not the feature.
2. **Repeat the social proof.** A single testimonial quote inside the pricing column boosts trust.
3. **Expose objections early.** Use the FAQ to answer refund, compatibility, and privacy questions.
4. **Make the button copy active.** "Get it now" and "Start downloading" outperform neutral phrases.
5. **Give them a reason to stay.** Add a lightweight guarantee or reminder about free updates below the CTA.

Try one or two of these ideas during your next experiment cycle and watch the analytics.
