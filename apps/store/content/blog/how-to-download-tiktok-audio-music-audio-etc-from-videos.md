# How to Download TikTok Audio (Music, Audio, etc.) from Videos

TikTok videos always contain both **audio and video** in a single MP4 file, but sometimes you just want the **audio track** — to save music, quotes, or background sounds.

Easy.

## 🎧 1. Extract Audio Only (MP3 Format)

If you want to save just the audio, use:

```bash
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 "https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/1234567890"
```

Flags explained:

•	-x → extract only the audio track
•	--audio-format mp3 → convert to MP3 (you can also use m4a, opus, or wav)

> ✅ Result: you’ll get an MP3 file with the video’s sound only.


## 🎼 2. Keep the Original Audio (No Re-encode)

If you want to keep TikTok’s native audio without re-encoding:

```bash
yt-dlp -x --audio-format best "https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/1234567890"
```

This preserves the original AAC or Opus audio track used by TikTok.


## 🪄 3. Add Metadata and Clean Filenames

To automatically name your files and embed metadata:
```bash
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 --add-metadata -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" "https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/1234567890"
```

	•	--add-metadata → embeds the creator and title into the file
	•	-o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" → names the file after the TikTok’s title


## ⚡ 4. Extract Both Video and Audio (Optional)

If you want both formats, you can chain commands:

```bash
yt-dlp "URL" && yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 "URL"
```

This saves the full MP4 and the audio-only MP3 version together.


## 🧠 Notes
	•	TikTok doesn’t provide separate audio files or transcripts.
Any captions or lyrics you see in the app are generated dynamically.
	•	yt-dlp uses FFmpeg under the hood to demux and convert the audio.
You don’t need to install or call FFmpeg manually — yt-dlp handles it.


## ✅ Want the Easy Way?

You can also extract TikTok audio online without touching the command line:

👉 [TikTok Video Downloader](http://serp.ly/tiktok-video-downloader) — paste any TikTok link, and it’ll generate downloadable video and audio-only files automatically.


## TL;DR:

Use yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 "URL" to pull audio from any TikTok — fast, simple, and watermark-free.
