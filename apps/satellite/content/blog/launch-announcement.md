It has never been easier to launch a product landing page. The SERP Apps lander template bundles the hero, pricing, testimonials, and FAQ sections you need into a single, reusable layout.

The page ships with:

- A media-rich hero with support for autoplay videos and screenshots.
- Opinionated feature rows that mirror our best-performing downloaders.
- A fully wired pricing call-to-action card ready to link to your checkout flow.
- YAML/JSON product data so marketing can edit content without touching code.

Over the coming weeks we will add more starter layouts, including long-form sales pages and comparison tables. Let us know which sections you want next!
