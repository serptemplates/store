Need to ship a new downloader lander fast? We’ve refined the process into a two-day sprint. Here’s the blueprint we use:

1. **Day 0 – Discover.** Confirm the product data, pricing, and testimonials you want to surface.
2. **Day 1 – Assemble.** Clone the lander template, wire the product YAML, and drop in media assets.
3. **Day 2 – Polish.** Update FAQ copy, run copy edits, and verify the checkout link with a dry run.

Once you’ve done it twice, you can go from idea to live URL before the weekend hits.
