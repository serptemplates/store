## Why this happens

Udemy videos often leverage hardware acceleration in the browser for DRM (Digital Rights Management) content protection. This can block:

- Loom screen recording
- OBS screen capture
- Screenshot tools (e.g., Snipping Tool, extensions)
- Mirroring to external monitors or AirPlay

The result: the video appears as a black screen even while playing.

## How to fix it in Google Chrome

### 1) Open Chrome settings
Click the 3 dots in the top-right corner ‚Üí Settings

### 2) Go to System settings
Scroll to the ‚ÄúSystem‚Äù section (or search for it)

### 3) Disable hardware acceleration
Find the toggle: ‚ÄúUse graphics acceleration when available‚Äù and turn it OFF

### 4) Relaunch Chrome
Chrome will prompt you to relaunch. Click it.

## Test again
Open Udemy, start a screen recording or take a screenshot ‚Äî it should work normally now. No more black screen.

## Works with

- Loom
- OBS Studio
- Snagit / Snipping Tool
- Mirroring tools (AirPlay, Chromecast, etc.)
- Any Chromium-based browser (Brave, Edge, etc.)

## Bonus tip
Using Firefox or Edge? Look for a similar hardware acceleration setting and disable it there.
