# How to Get Any Udemy Course at the Maximum Discount 💸
> Step-by-step guide to unlocking Udemy’s lowest prices, even if you're already logged in.

Udemy often restricts new-user coupon codes and pushes subscriptions. This trick bypasses that and gets you 82–90% off pretty much any course — even on your main account.

Note: This is a white-hat coupon workflow using Udemy’s own systems — nothing illegal or shady.

## TL;DR — Quick Summary

1. Open the course in Incognito mode
2. Trigger Udemy’s new‑user discount
3. Use “Gift this course” to send it to your main account
4. Pay from your second account
5. Redeem on your main account — lowest possible price

## Full Step‑by‑Step Instructions

### 1) Open course in Incognito
- Go to the course URL.
- Remove any `?couponCode=` query if present.
- Paste it into a private/incognito window or a different browser.

This tricks Udemy into thinking you're a new visitor.

### 2) Look for “New Learner Offer”
- You’ll often see a banner like “New Learner Offer – Click to Redeem”.
- After clicking it, you'll see a massive discount applied (often 82% off).
- Note the discounted price.

### 3) Click “Gift this course”
- Do not buy it directly.
- Click “Gift this course” instead.

This lets you buy the discounted course for someone else, even if you’re not logged in.

### 4) Log in with a second Udemy account
- If prompted, log in with a different account (email2).
- You can create a new one if needed — a burner email is fine.

### 5) Gift to your main account
- In the gift screen, enter any name.
- For recipient email, enter your main Udemy account email (email1).
- Proceed to checkout and pay.

### 6) Redeem on your main account
- You’ll get a confirmation with a gift voucher code.
- Log into your main Udemy account.
- Add the course to your cart, go to checkout, and paste the voucher.

That’s it — the course is now free on your main account.

## Why this works
Udemy applies new‑user discounts at the browser/session level but restricts logged‑in users from seeing them. The gift feature bypasses this: your second account buys at the best price; your main account receives it as a gift.

## Repeat for any course
Just repeat:
1) Incognito → course URL → 2) trigger discount → 3) gift to main → 4) redeem and learn 🎉

## Notes & tips
- You’re using built‑in features; avoid excessive repetition from the same IP.
- Works best on courses not already discounted on your logged‑in account.

## Bonus: Disposable emails
- Mail.tm or Temp‑Mail make quick secondary accounts easy.

## Final thoughts
Udemy’s pricing rewards first‑time visitors. This workflow evens the playing field so you don’t overpay.
Happy learning, at a fraction of the cost!
