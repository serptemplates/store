# How to Download TikTok Audio (Music, Audio, etc.) from Videos

TikTok videos always contain both **audio and video** in a single MP4 file, but sometimes you just want the **audio track** â€” to save music, quotes, or background sounds.

Easy.

## ðŸŽ§ 1. Extract Audio Only (MP3 Format)

If you want to save just the audio, use:

```bash
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 "https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/1234567890"
```

Flags explained:

â€¢	-x â†’ extract only the audio track
â€¢	--audio-format mp3 â†’ convert to MP3 (you can also use m4a, opus, or wav)

> âœ… Result: youâ€™ll get an MP3 file with the videoâ€™s sound only.


## ðŸŽ¼ 2. Keep the Original Audio (No Re-encode)

If you want to keep TikTokâ€™s native audio without re-encoding:

```bash
yt-dlp -x --audio-format best "https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/1234567890"
```

This preserves the original AAC or Opus audio track used by TikTok.


## ðŸª„ 3. Add Metadata and Clean Filenames

To automatically name your files and embed metadata:
```bash
yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 --add-metadata -o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" "https://www.tiktok.com/@user/video/1234567890"
```

	â€¢	--add-metadata â†’ embeds the creator and title into the file
	â€¢	-o "%(title)s.%(ext)s" â†’ names the file after the TikTokâ€™s title


## âš¡ 4. Extract Both Video and Audio (Optional)

If you want both formats, you can chain commands:

```bash
yt-dlp "URL" && yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 "URL"
```

This saves the full MP4 and the audio-only MP3 version together.


## ðŸ§  Notes
	â€¢	TikTok doesnâ€™t provide separate audio files or transcripts.
Any captions or lyrics you see in the app are generated dynamically.
	â€¢	yt-dlp uses FFmpeg under the hood to demux and convert the audio.
You donâ€™t need to install or call FFmpeg manually â€” yt-dlp handles it.

## TL;DR:

Use yt-dlp -x --audio-format mp3 "URL" to pull audio from any TikTok â€” fast, simple, and watermark-free.
