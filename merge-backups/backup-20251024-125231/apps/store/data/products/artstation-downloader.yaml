  - question: How do I use ArtStation Downloader?
    answer: Open ArtStation, choose the images and project assets you need, and
      start the download directly from the app. Files save to your designated
      folder immediately.
  - question: What quality options are available?
    answer: ArtStation Downloader keeps the highest quality available from
      ArtStation, preserving resolution, bitrate, and metadata whenever
      possible.
  - question: Does this work with private or DRM content?
    answer: It's designed for publicly accessible material that you have rights to
      download. It doesn't bypass DRM, logins, or paywalls.
  - question: Can I run bulk downloads?
    answer: Yes. Queue multiple links and the downloader processes them sequentially
      with automatic retries if the connection drops.
  - question: Is my data tracked?
    answer: No. Downloads stay on your device and we don't capture usage analytics
      or content copies.
