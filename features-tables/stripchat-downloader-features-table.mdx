## Supported Formats

- **HLS (m3u8)** master playlists with variant tracks
- **Multiple resolutions** detected from `#EXT-X-STREAM-INF` metadata
- **Automatic ordering** (highest quality first in the UI)

## Requirements

- Chrome/Chromium browser (Manifest V3)
- Valid license key activation
- Active public Stripchat stream (private shows are blocked)
- Stable internet connection for license verification and HLS segment downloads

## Supported Stripchat URLs

- Model rooms: `https://stripchat.com/{username}`
- Subdomains hosting the web client: `https://*.stripchat.com/*`
- Mobile site: `https://m.stripchat.com/*`

## User Interface Highlights

- **License activation** modal for email + key validation
- **Stream metadata**: room title, status messaging, live viewer count
- **Quality picker** populated from HLS variants
- **Download manager** overlay with cancel + retry options
- **Context menu shortcut** for quick captures
- **Inline help** housed inside the popup

## Technical Features

- **Preloaded state parsing**: consumes `window.__PRELOADED_STATE__` for model + HLS hosts
- **Host fallback resolution**: walks `config` + `configV3` features to find working HLS domains
- **Dynamic re-query**: periodic data refresh while the page stays open
- **HLS variant parsing**: builds quality list from master manifest metadata
- **Offscreen worker**: persists downloads even if tab is closed/reloaded
- **Blob assembly**: stitches segments and hands off to `chrome.downloads`

## Important Limitations

- **Only public streams** – private shows report an error instead of downloading
- **Stripchat exclusive** – other cam platforms are not supported by this build
- **HLS only** – MP4 recording is not available
- **Chrome only** – no Firefox/Safari/Edge packaging yet
- **License required** – features stay locked until activation succeeds
- **No auto-detection of past shows** – the stream must be live while capturing
